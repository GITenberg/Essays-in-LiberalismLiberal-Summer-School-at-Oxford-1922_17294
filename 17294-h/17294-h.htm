<h2><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v"></a><span class="pagenum" title="v"></span><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The papers contained in this volume are summaries&#8212;in
some cases, owing to the defectiveness of
the reports, very much abridged summaries&#8212;of a
series of discourses delivered at the Liberal Summer
School at Oxford in the first ten days of August,
1922. In two cases (&#8220;The State and Industry&#8221;
and &#8220;The Machinery of Government&#8221;) two lectures
have been condensed into a single paper.</p>

<p>The Summer School was not arranged by any
of the official organisations of the Liberal party,
nor was any part of its expenses paid out of party
funds. It was the outcome of a spontaneous movement
among a number of men and women who,
believing that Liberalism is beyond all other
political creeds dependent upon the free discussion
of ideas, came to the conclusion that it was desirable
to create a platform upon which such discussion
could be carried on, in a manner quite different
from what is usual, or indeed practicable, at
ordinary official party gatherings. From the
first the movement received cordial support and
encouragement from the leaders of the party, who
were more than content that a movement so
<a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi"></a><span class="pagenum" title="vi"></span>essentially Liberal in character should be carried
on quite independently of any official control.
The meetings were inaugurated by an address by
Mr. Asquith, and wound up by a valediction from
Lord Grey, while nearly all the recognised leaders
of the party presided at one or more of the meetings,
or willingly consented to give lectures. In short,
while wholly unofficial, the meetings drew together
all that is most vital in modern Liberalism.</p>

<p>In some degree the Summer School represented
a new departure in political discussion. Most of
the lectures were delivered, not by active politicians,
but by scholars and experts whose distinction has
been won in other fields than practical politics.
One or two of the speakers were, indeed, not even
professed Liberals. They were invited to speak
because it was known that on their subjects they
would express the true mind of modern Liberalism.
Whatever Lord Robert Cecil, for example, may
call himself, Liberals at any rate recognise that on
most subjects he expresses their convictions.</p>

<p>As a glance at the list of contents will show, the
papers cover almost the whole range of political
interest, foreign, domestic, and imperial, but the
greatest emphasis is laid upon the problems of
economic and industrial organisation. Yet, since
it is impossible to survey the universe in ten days,
there are large and important themes which remain
<a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii"></a><span class="pagenum" title="vii"></span>unexplored, while many subjects of vital significance
are but lightly touched upon. Perhaps the most
notable of these omissions is that of any treatment
of local government, and of the immensely important
subjects&#8212;education, public health, housing,
and the like&#8212;for which local authorities are
primarily held responsible. These subjects are
held over for fuller treatment in later schools; and
for that reason two papers&#8212;one on local government
and one on education&#8212;which were delivered
at Oxford have not been included in the present
volume.</p>

<p>It must be obvious, from what has been said
above, that these papers make no pretence to
define what may be called an official programme
or policy for the Liberal party. It was with study
rather than with programme-making that the
School was concerned, and its aim was the stimulation
of free inquiry rather than the formulation
of dogmas. Every speaker was, and is, responsible
for the views expressed in his paper, though not
for the form which the abridged report of it has
assumed; and there are doubtless passages in this
book which would not win the assent of all Liberals,
for Liberalism has always encouraged and welcomed
varieties of opinion.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, taken as a whole, these papers do
fairly represent the outlook and temper of modern
<a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii"></a><span class="pagenum" title="viii"></span>Liberalism. And the candid reader will not fail
to recognise in them a certain unity of tone and
temper, in spite of the diversity of their authorship
and subject-matter. Whether the subject is
foreign politics, or imperial problems, or government,
or industry, the same temper shows itself&#8212;a
belief in freedom rather than in regimentation;
an earnest desire to substitute law for force; a
belief in persuasion rather than in compulsion as
the best mode of solving difficult problems; an
eagerness to establish organised methods of discussion
and co-operation as the best solvent of
strife, in international relations and in industrial
affairs quite as much as in the realm of national
politics, to which these methods have long since
been applied.</p>

<p>That is the spirit of modern Liberalism, which
gives unity to the diversity of this little volume.
As has often been said, Liberalism is an attitude of
mind rather than a body of definitely formulated
doctrine. It does not claim to know of any formula
which will guide us out of all our troubles, or of any
panacea that will cure every social ill. It recognises
that we are surrounded in every field of social and
political life by infinitely difficult problems for
which there is no easy solution. It puts its trust
in the honest inquiry and thought of free men who
take their civic responsibilities seriously.</p>

<h2><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1"></a><span class="pagenum" title="1"></span><a name="THE_LEAGUE_OF_NATIONS" id="THE_LEAGUE_OF_NATIONS"></a>THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS
AND THE
REHABILITATION OF EUROPE</h2>

<h3>By the Rt. Hon. Lord Robert Cecil</h3>

<h4>K.C., M.P., Assistant Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,
1918. Minister of Blockade, 1916-1918. Representative
of Union of South Africa at Assembly of League
of Nations.</h4>


<p>Lord Robert Cecil said:&#8212;I ought to explain
that I am here rather by accident. The speaker
who was to have addressed you was my great
personal friend, Professor Gilbert Murray, and you
have greatly suffered because he is not present.
He is prevented by being at Geneva on a matter
connected with the League, and he suggested that
I might take his place. I was very glad to do so,
for, let me say quite frankly, I am ready to advocate
the League of Nations before any assembly, certainly
not least an assembly of Liberals. But not only
an assembly of Liberals&#8212;I should be ready to
advocate it even before an assembly of &#8220;Die-Hards.&#8221;</p>

<p>Your chairman has said, and said truly, that
the League is not a party question. We welcome,
we are anxious for support from every one. We
have seen in another great country the very grave
danger that may accrue to the cause of the League
if it unhappily becomes identified with party
<a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a><span class="pagenum" title="2"></span>politics. We welcome support, yes, I will say even
from the Prime Minister; indeed no one will reject
the support of the Prime Minister of England for
any cause. I am bound to admit when I first
read the speech to which reference has already
been made, I was a little reminded of the celebrated
letter of Dr. Johnson to Lord Chesterfield. Lord
Chesterfield only began to recognise the value of
Johnson&#8217;s works when Johnson had already succeeded,
and in one of the bitter phrases Dr. Johnson
then used he said, &#8220;Is not a patron one who looks
with unconcern on a man struggling for life in the
water, and when he has reached ground incommodes
him with help?&#8221; That was a passing phase in my
mind, and I am a little ashamed of it, because,
after all, we cannot say the League has reached
ground as yet. We need and are grateful for the
help of any one who will genuinely come to its
assistance. I hope we may look not only for words,
but for deeds. The League needs all the support
it can get in the very perilous and menacing times
which are before us. I was glad to note that the
Government has announced&#8212;it is one of the great
test questions&#8212;that not only is it in favour of the
entry of Germany into the League, but it would
support the election of Germany to the Council of
the League. That is an earnest of what we trust
may be a real League policy from the Government
of this country. And yet, though I have thought
it right to emphasise the non-party aspect of this
question, I am conscious, and I am sure all of you
are, there are two ways in which the League is
regarded. It is not only that, as your chairman
<a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a><span class="pagenum" title="3"></span>would say, some people have more faith than others,
but there is really a distinct attitude of mind
adopted by some supporters of the League from
that adopted by others.</p>


<h3>The Two Views of the League</h3>

<p>There is what I may call the empirical view of
the League. There are those of us in this country,
and indeed all over the world, who, profoundly
impressed with the horrors of war, hating war
from the bottom of their hearts as an evil thing&#8212;a
company which must include, as far as I can see,
all Christian men and women&#8212;these people, impressed
with the horrors of war, look about for some
means of keeping it away, some safeguard against
its renewal. And they say: &#8220;We have tried
everything else, we have tried the doctrine of the
preparation for war as a great safeguard of peace;
we have tried the doctrine of the Balance of Power;
we have tried the doctrine of making one State or
group of States so powerful that it can enforce its
will on the rest of the world. We have tried all
these expedients, and we are driven to the conclusion
that they lead not to peace, but to war.
Is there anything else?&#8221; And then they come
quite legitimately to the League as their last hope
of preserving the peace of the world. I was talking
to a distinguished Frenchman the other day, and
that was his attitude. It is the attitude of a great
many people. In my judgment it is quite sound
as far as it goes. But it is not inspiring. It depends
<a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a><span class="pagenum" title="4"></span>in the last resort merely on a frank appeal to the
terrors of mankind.</p>

<p>Against that view you may set the more fundamental
way of approaching this question. You
may say if you are to have peace in the world it is
not enough merely to provide safeguards against
war. You must aim at creating a new international
spirit, a new spirit in international affairs; you
must build from the very foundations. That is the
positive as opposed to the negative way of approaching
this question. It is not enough to cast out the
war spirit and leave its habitation swept and
garnished. You have to replace the war spirit by
a spirit of international co-operation. And that
is the way of regarding this great movement which
some people think can be disposed of by describing
it as idealism&#8212;a favourite term of abuse, I learn,
now, but which seems to me not only good
politics and good morality, but common sense as
well.</p>


<h3>The Negative and the Positive</h3>

<p>These two points of view do represent undoubtedly
fundamental differences of political attitude, and
you will find that the two sets of advocates or supporters
of the League whom I have tried to describe,
will inevitably regard with different emphasis the
provisions of the Covenant, and even the achievements
of the League. For if you read the Covenant
you will find two sets of provisions in that document.
It does recognise the two schools, as it were, that
I have been describing. It has a set of provisions
<a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a><span class="pagenum" title="5"></span>which deal with the enforcement, the safeguarding
of peace, and a set of provisions which deal with
the building up of international co-operation.
You will notice the two sets of provisions. There
are those aiming directly at the settlement of
disputes without war. This is the central part of
the League. It is the first thing before you can
hope to do anything else. Before you can begin
to build up your international spirit you must get
rid as far as you can of the actual menace of war;
and in that sense this is the central part of the
Covenant. But, in my view, the most enduring
and perhaps the most important part is that set of
provisions which cluster round the group of articles
beginning with Article 10 perhaps, certainly Article
12, and going on to Article 17&#8212;the group which
says in effect that before nations submit their
disputes to the arbitrament of war they are bound
to try every other means of settling their differences.
It lays down first the principle that every dispute
should come to some kind of arbitration, either by
the new Court of International Justice&#8212;one of the
great achievements of the League&#8212;or discussion
before a specially constituted Arbitration Court,
or failing both, then discussion before the Council
of the League; and Articles 15 and 16 provide that
until that discussion has taken place, and until
adequate time has been allowed for the public
opinion of the world to operate on the disputants
as the result of that examination, no war is to take
place, and if any war takes place the aggressor is
to be regarded as perhaps what may be called an
international outlaw.</p>

<p><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a><span class="pagenum" title="6"></span>Before you begin to build you must have freedom
from actual war, and the provisions have been
effective. They are not merely theoretic. I am
not sure whether it is generally recognised, even
in so instructed an assembly as this, how successful
these provisions have actually been in practice.
Let me give you briefly two illustrations: the
dispute between Sweden and Finland, and the
much more urgent case of the dispute between
Serbia and Albania. In the first case you had a
dispute about the possession of certain islands in
the Baltic. It was boiling up to be a serious
danger to the peace of the world. It was referred
to the League for discussion. It was before the
existence of the International Court. A special
tribunal was constituted. The matter was threshed
out with great elaboration; a decision was come
to which, it is interesting to observe, was a decision
against the stronger of the two parties. It was
accepted, not with enthusiasm by the party that
lost, but with great loyalty. It has been adopted,
worked out in its details by other organs of the
League, and as far as one can tell, as far as it is
safe to prophesy about anything, it has absolutely
closed that dispute, and the two countries are
living in a greater degree of amity than existed
before the dispute became acute.</p>

<p>But the Albanian case is stronger. You had a
very striking case: a small country only just
struggling into international existence. Albania
had only just been created before the war as an
independent State, and during the war its independence
had in effect vanished. The first thing that
<a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a><span class="pagenum" title="7"></span>happened was its application for membership of
the League. That was granted, and thereby Albania
came into existence really for the first time as an
independent State. Then came its effort to secure
the boundaries to which it was entitled, which had
been provisionally awarded to it before the war.
While that dispute was still unsettled, its neighbour,
following some rather disastrous examples
given by greater people in Europe, thought to solve
the question by seizing even more of the land of
Albania than it already occupied. Thereupon the
Articles of the Covenant were brought into operation.
The Council was hastily summoned within
a few days. It was known that this country was
prepared to advocate before that Council the
adoption of the coercive measures described in
Article 16. The Council met, and the aggressive
State immediately recognised that as a member of
the League it had no course open but to comply
with its obligations, and that as a prudent State it
dared not face the danger which would be caused
to it by the operation of Article 16. Immediately,
before the dispute had actually been developed,
before the Council, the Serbians announced that
they were prepared to withdraw from Albanian
territory, and gave orders to their troops to retire
beyond the boundary. Let us recognise that this
decision having been come to, it was carried out
with absolute loyalty and completeness. The
troops withdrew. The territory was restored to
Albania without a hitch. No ill-feeling remains
behind, and the next thing we hear is that a commercial
treaty is entered into between the two
<a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a><span class="pagenum" title="8"></span>States, so that they can live in peace and amity
together.</p>


<h3>The Spirit of the League</h3>

<p>I want to emphasise one point about these two
cases. It is not so much that the coercive powers
provided in the Covenant were effectively used.
In Sweden and Finland they never came into the
question at all, and in the other case there was
merely a suggestion of their operation. What
really brought about a settlement of these two
disputes was that the countries concerned really
desired peace, and were really anxious to comply
with their obligations as members of the League of
Nations. That is the essential thing&#8212;the League
spirit. And if you want to see how essential it is
you have to compare another international incident:
the dispute between Poland and Lithuania, where
the League spirit was conspicuous by its absence.
There you had a dispute of the same character.
But ultimately you did secure this: that from the
date of the intervention of the League till the
present day&#8212;about two years&#8212;there has been no
fighting; actual hostilities were put an end to.
Though that is in itself an immensely satisfactory
result, and an essential preliminary for all future
international progress, yet one must add that
the dispute still continues, and there is much
recrimination and bitterness between the two countries.
The reason why only partial success has been
attained is because one must say Poland has shown
a miserable lack of the true spirit of the League.</p>

<p><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a><span class="pagenum" title="9"></span>Let me turn to the other parts of the Covenant&#8212;those
which aim directly at building up international
co-operation. I am not sure that it is
always sufficiently realised that that is not only an
implicit but also an explicit object of the Covenant&#8212;that
it is the main purpose for which the League
exists. International co-operation are the very
first words of the preamble to the Covenant. This
is the fundamental idea I cannot insist on too
strongly, because it does really go down to the
very foundations of my whole creed in political
matters. International co-operation, class co-operation,
individual co-operation&#8212;that is the essential
spirit if we are to solve the difficulties before us.
Let me remind you of the two instances of the
action of the League in dealing with the threat of
epidemics to Europe. A conference was called at
Washington to consider what could be done to
save Europe from the danger of epidemics coming
from the East. What is interesting is that in that
conference you had present not only members of the
League considering and devising means for the
safety of Europe, but you had representatives of
Germany and Russia&#8212;a splendid example of the
promotion of international co-operation extending
even beyond the limits of the membership of the
League. Admirable work was done. All countries
co-operated quite frankly and willingly under the
presidency of a distinguished Polish scientist.</p>

<p>That is one example of what we mean by international
co-operation. Perhaps an even more
striking example was the great work of Dr. Nansen
in liberating the prisoners of war who were in
<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a><span class="pagenum" title="10"></span>Russia. He was entrusted with the work on behalf
of the League. The prisoners of war belonged to
all nationalities, including our enemies in the late
war. He accomplished his work because he went
about it in the true spirit of the League, merely
anxious to promote the welfare of all, leaving aside
all prejudices whether arising from the war or from
any other cause. Dr. Nansen is in my judgment
the incarnation of the spirit of the League, and his
work, immensely successful, restored to their
homes some 350,000 persons, and he did it for
less money than he originally estimated it would
cost.</p>

<p>Do not put me down as a facile optimist in this
matter. In the matter of international co-operation
we have a long way to go before we reach our goal,
and we can already see one or two serious failures.
I deeply deplore that last year the League found
itself unable, through the instructions given by the
Governments which composed it, to do anything
effective on behalf of the famine in Russia. It was
a most deplorable failure for the League, and still
more deplorable for this country. It was a great
opportunity for us to show that we really did mean
to be actuated by a new spirit in international
affairs, and that we did recognise that the welfare
of all human beings was part&#8212;if you like to put it
so&#8212;of our national interests. We failed to make
that recognition. We have been trying feebly
and unsuccessfully to repair that great mistake
ever since, and for my part I do not believe there
is any hope of a solution of the Russian difficulty
until we absolutely acknowledge the failure we
<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a><span class="pagenum" title="11"></span>then made, and begin even at this late hour to
retrace the false step we then took.</p>

<p>I could give other instances of failure, but I do
not wish to depress you, and there are cheering
things we may look at. It is a matter of great
relief and congratulation that the policy of mandates
really does appear to be becoming effective, and one
of the greatest activities of the League. Nothing
is better than the conception which the mandate
clause embodies, that the old ideas of conquest
are to be put aside; that you are not to allow
nations to go out and take chunks of territory for
themselves; that they must hold new territory not
for themselves, but on behalf of and for the benefit
of mankind at large. This is at the bottom of
mandates. Since I am speaking on behalf of
Professor Murray, I ought to remind you of the
provisions of the Covenant for the protection of
racial linguistic minorities, and minorities in
different countries. It has not yet become an
effective part of the machinery of the League, but
I look forward to the time when we shall have
established the doctrine that all racial minorities
are entitled to be treated on a footing absolutely
equal with other nationals of the country in which
they live. If that could be established, one of the
great difficulties in the way of international co-operation
in the spirit of peace will be removed.</p>


<h3>The Mistake of Versailles</h3>

<p>These are the two aspects I wanted to bring
before you. If we are to get down to the root of
<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a><span class="pagenum" title="12"></span>the matter; if we are to uproot the old jungle
theory of international relations, we must recognise
that the chief danger and difficulty before us is
what may be described as excessive nationalism.
We have to recognise in this and other countries
that a mere belief in narrow national interests
will never really take you anywhere. You must
recognise that humanity can only exist and prosper
as a whole, and that you cannot separate the
nation in which you live, and say you will work for
its prosperity and welfare alone, without considering
that its prosperity and welfare depend on that
of others. And the differences on that point go
right through a great deal of the political thought
of the day.</p>

<p>Take the question of reparations. I am not going
to discuss in detail what ought to be done in that
difficult and vexed question, but I want to call
your attention to the mistake which was originally
made, and which we have never yet been able to
retrieve. The fundamental error of Versailles was
the failure to recognise that even in dealing with
a conquered enemy you can only successfully
proceed by co-operation. That was the mistake&#8212;the
idea that the victorious Powers could impose
their will without regard to the feelings and desires
and national sentiment of their enemy, even
though he was beaten. For the first time in the
history of peace conferences, the vanquished Power
was not allowed to take part in any real discussion
of the terms of the treaty. The attitude adopted
was, &#8220;These are our terms, take or leave them,
but you will get nothing else.&#8221; No attempt
<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a><span class="pagenum" title="13"></span>was made to appreciate, or even investigate
the view put forward by the Germans on that
occasion. And last, but not least, they were most
unfortunately excluded from membership of the
League at that time. I felt profoundly indignant
with the Germans and their conduct of the war.
I still believe it was due almost exclusively to the
German policy and the policy of their rulers that
the war took place, and that it was reasonable and
right to feel profound indignation, and to desire
that international misdeeds of that character
should be adequately punished. But what was
wrong was to think that you could as a matter of
practice or of international ethics try to impose by
main force a series of provisions without regard to
the consent or dissent of the country on which you
were trying to impose them. That is part of the
heresy that force counts for everything. I wish
some learned person in Oxford or elsewhere would
write an essay to show how little force has been
able to achieve in the world. And the curious and
the really remarkable thing is that it was this
heresy which brought Germany herself to grief.
It is because of the false and immoral belief in
the all-powerfulness of force that Germany has
fallen, and yet those opposed to Germany, though
they conquered her, adopted only too much of
her moral code.</p>

<p>It was because the Allies really adopted the
doctrine of the mailed fist that we are now suffering
from the terrible economic difficulties and dangers
which surround us. I venture to insist on that
now, because there are a large number of people
<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a><span class="pagenum" title="14"></span>who have not abandoned that view. There are
still a number of people who think the real failure
that has been committed is not that we went wrong,
as I think, in our negotiations at Versailles, but
that we have not exerted enough force, and that
the remedy for the present situation is more threats
of force. I am sure it won&#8217;t answer. I want to say
that that doctrine is just as pernicious when applied
to France as when applied to Germany. You have
made an agreement. You have signed and ratified
a treaty; you are internationally bound by that
treaty. It is no use turning round and with a new
incarnation of the policy of the mailed fist threatening
one of your co-signatories that they are bound
to abandon the rights which you wrongly and
foolishly gave to them under that treaty.</p>

<p>I am against a policy based on force as applied
to Germany. I am equally opposed to a policy
based on force as applied to France. If we really
understand the creed for which we stand, we must
aim at co-operation all round. If we have made
a mistake we must pay for it. If we are really
anxious to bring peace to the world, and particularly
to Europe, we must be prepared for sacrifices. We
have got to establish economic peace, and if we
don&#8217;t establish it in a very short time we shall be
faced with economic ruin. In the strictest, most
nationalistic interests of this country, we have to
see that economic war comes to an end. We have
got to make whatever concessions are necessary
in order to bring that peace into being.</p>


<h3><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a><span class="pagenum" title="15"></span>Economic Peace</h3>

<p>That is true not only of the reparation question;
it is true of our whole economic policy. We have
been preaching to Europe, and quite rightly, that
the erection of economic barriers between countries
is a treachery to the whole spirit of the League of
Nations, and all that it means, and yet with these
words scarcely uttered we turn round and pass
through Parliament a new departure in our economic
system which is the very contradiction of everything
we have said in international conference.</p>

<p>The Safeguarding of Industries Act is absolutely
opposed to the whole spirit and purpose which the
League of Nations has in view. A reference was
made by your chairman to Lord Grey, and I saw in
a very distinguished organ of the Coalition an
attack on his recent speech. We are told that he
ought not at this crisis to be suggesting that the
present Government is not worthy of our confidence,
but how can we trust the present Government?
How is it possible to trust them when one finds at
Brussels, at Genoa, at the Hague, and elsewhere they
preach the necessity of the economic unity of
Europe, and then go down to the House of Commons
and justify this Act on the strictest, the baldest,
the most unvarnished doctrine of economic particularism
for this country? Nor does it stop
there. I told you just now that for me this doctrine
on which the League is based goes right through
many other problems than those of a strictly
international character. You will never solve
<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a><span class="pagenum" title="16"></span>Indian or Egyptian difficulties by a reliance on
force and force alone. I believe that the deplorable,
the scandalous condition to which the neighbouring
island of Ireland has been reduced is largely due
to the failure to recognise that by unrestricted
unreasoning, and sometimes immoral force, you
cannot reach the solution of the difficulties of that
country.</p>

<p>And in industry it is the same thing. If you are
really to get a solution of these great problems,
depend upon it you will never do it by strikes and
lock-outs. I am an outsider in industrial matters.
I am reproached when I venture to say anything
about them with the observation that I am no
business man. I can only hope that in this case
lookers-on may sometimes see most of the game.
But to me it is profoundly depressing when I see
whichever section of the industrial world happens
to have the market with it&#8212;whether employers or
wage-earners&#8212;making it its only concern to down
the other party as much as it can. You will never
reach a solution that way. You have to recognise
in industrial as in international affairs that the
spirit of co-operation, the spirit of partnership, is
your only hope of salvation.</p>


<h3>The Two Causes of Unrest</h3>

<p>What is the conclusion of what I have tried to
say to you? There are at the present time two
great causes of fighting and hostility. There used
to be three. There was a time when men fought
about religious doctrine, and though I do not
<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a><span class="pagenum" title="17"></span>defend it, it was perhaps less sordid than some of
our fights to-day. Now the two great causes of
fighting are greed and fear. Generally speaking,
I think we may say that greed in international
matters is a less potent cause of hostility than fear.
The disease the world is suffering from is the
disease of fear and suspicion. You see it between
man and man, between class and class, and most
of all between nation and nation. People reproach
this great country and other great countries with
being unreasonable or unwilling to make concessions.
If you look deeply into it you will find always the
same cause. It is not mere perversity; it is fear
and fear alone that makes men unreasonable and
contentious. It is no new thing; it has existed from
the foundation of the world. The Prime Minister
the other day said, and said quite truly, that the
provisions of the Covenant, however admirable, were
not in themselves sufficient to secure the peace of
the world. He made an appeal, quite rightly, to
the religious forces and organisations to assist. I
agree, but after all something may be done by
political action, and something by international
organisation. In modern medicine doctors are
constantly telling us they cannot cure any disease&#8212;all
they can do is to give nature a chance. No
Covenant will teach men to be moral or peace-loving,
but you can remove, diminish, or modify
the conditions which make for war, and take
obstacles out of the way of peace. We advocate
partnership in industry and social life. We advocate
self-government, international co-operation. We
recognise that these are no ends in themselves;
<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a><span class="pagenum" title="18"></span>they are means to the end; they are the influences
which will facilitate the triumph of the right and
impede the success of the wrong.</p>

<p>But looking deeper into the matter, to the very
foundations, we recognise, all of us, the most
devoted adherents of the League, and all men of
goodwill, that in the end we must strive for the
brotherhood of man. We admit we can do comparatively
little to help it forward. We recognise
that our efforts, whether by covenant or other
means, must necessarily be imperfect; but we say,
and say rightly, that we have been told that perfect
love casteth out fear, and that any step towards
that love, however imperfect, will at any rate
mitigate the terrors of mankind.</p>

<h2><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a><span class="pagenum" title="19"></span><a name="THE_BALANCE_OF_POWER" id="THE_BALANCE_OF_POWER"></a>THE BALANCE OF POWER</h2>

<h3>By Professor A.F. Pollard</h3>

<h4>Hon. Litt.D.; Fellow of All Souls&#8217; College, Oxford;
F.B.A.; Professor of English History in the
University of London; Chairman of the Institute
of Historical Research.</h4>


<p>Professor Pollard said:&#8212;The usual alternative
to the League of Nations, put forward as a means
of averting war by those who desire or profess to
desire permanent peace, but dislike or distrust the
League of Nations, is what they call the Balance of
Power. It is a familiar phrase; but the thing for
which the words are supposed to stand, has, if it
can save us from war, so stupendous a virtue that
it is worth while inquiring what it means, if it has
any meaning at all. For words are not the same
as things, and the more a phrase is used the less it
tends to mean: verbal currency, like the coinage,
gets worn with use until in time it has to be
called in as bad. The time has come to recall the
Balance of Power as a phrase that has completely
lost the value it possessed when originally it was
coined.</p>

<p>Recent events have made an examination of the
doctrine of the Balance of Power a matter of some
urgency. The Allies who won the war concluded
a pact to preserve the peace, but in that pact they
have not yet been able to include Germany or
<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a><span class="pagenum" title="20"></span>Russia or the United States, three Powers which
are, potentially at any rate, among the greatest in
the world. So, some fifty years ago, Bismarck,
who won three wars in the mid-Victorian age, set
himself to build up a pact of peace. But his Triple
Alliance was not only used to restrain, but abused
to repress, the excluded Powers; and that abuse
of a pact of peace drove the excluded Powers,
France and Russia, into each other&#8217;s arms. There
resulted the Balance of Power which produced the
war we have barely survived. And hardly was
the great war fought and won than we saw
the wheel beginning to revolve once more. The
excluded Powers, repressed or merely restrained,
began to draw together; others than Turkey might
gravitate in the same direction, while the United
States stands in splendid isolation as much aloof
as we were from the Triple Alliance and the Dual
Entente a generation ago. Another Balance of
Power loomed on the horizon. &#8220;Let us face the
facts,&#8221; declared the <em>Morning Post</em> on 22nd April
last, &#8220;we are back again to the doctrine of the
Balance of Power, whatever the visionaries and
the blind may say.&#8221; I propose to deal, as faithfully
as I can in the time at my disposal, with the
visionaries and the blind&#8212;when we have discovered
who they are.</p>

<p>By &#8220;visionaries&#8221; I suppose the <em>Morning Post</em>
means those who believe in the League of Nations;
and by the &#8220;blind&#8221; I suppose it means them, too,
though usually a distinction is drawn between
those who see too much and those who cannot see
at all. Nor need we determine whether those who
<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a><span class="pagenum" title="21"></span>believe in the Balance of Power belong rather to
the visionaries or to the blind. A man may be
receiving less than his due when he is asked whether
he is a knave or a fool, because the form of the
question seems to preclude the proper answer,
which may be &#8220;both.&#8221; Believers in the Balance
of Power are visionaries if they see in it a guarantee
of peace, and blind if they fail to perceive that it
naturally and almost inevitably leads to war.
The fundamental antithesis is between the Balance
of Power and the League of Nations.</p>


<h3>Balance or League?</h3>

<p>That antithesis comes out wherever the problem
of preserving the peace of the world is seriously
and intelligently discussed. Six years ago, when
he began to turn his attention to this subject,
Lord Robert Cecil wrote and privately circulated
a memorandum in which he advocated something
like a League of Nations. To that memorandum
an able reply was drafted by an eminent authority
in the Foreign Office, in which it was contended
that out of the discussion &#8220;the Balance of Power
emerges as the fundamental factor.&#8221; That criticism
for the time being checked official leanings
towards a League of Nations. But the war went
on, threatening to end in a balance of power,
which was anything but welcome to those who
combined a theoretical belief in the Balance of
Power with a practical demand for its complete
destruction by an overwhelming victory for our
Allies and ourselves. Meanwhile, before America
<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a><span class="pagenum" title="22"></span>came in, President Wilson was declaring that, in
order to guarantee the permanence of such a
settlement as would commend itself to the United
States, there must be, not &#8220;a Balance of Power
but a Community of Power.&#8221;</p>

<p>Opinion in England was moving in the same
direction. The League of Nations Society (afterwards
called &#8220;Union&#8221;) had been formed, and at
a great meeting on 14th May, 1917, speeches
advocating some such league as the best means of
preventing future wars were delivered by Lord
Bryce, General Smuts, the Archbishop of Canterbury,
Lord Hugh Cecil, and others. Labour was
even more emphatic; and, responding to popular
opinion, the Government, at Christmas, 1917,
appointed a small committee to explore the historical,
juridical, and diplomatic bearings of the suggested
solution. A brief survey sufficed to show that
attempts to guarantee the peace of the world
resolved themselves into three categories: (1) a
Monopoly of Power, (2) Balance of Power, and
(3) Community of Power. Rome had established
the longest peace in history by subjugating all
her rivals and creating a <em>Pax Romana</em> imposed
by a world-wide Empire. That Empire lasted
for centuries, and the idea persisted throughout
the middle ages. In modern times Philip II.
of Spain, Louis XIV. of France, Napoleon, and
even the Kaiser were suspected of attempting to
revive it; and their efforts provoked the counter
idea, first of a Balance of Power, and then in these
latter days of a Community of Power. The conception
of a Monopoly of Power was by common consent
<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a><span class="pagenum" title="23"></span>abandoned as impossible and intolerable, after the
rise of nationality, by all except the particular
aspirants to the monopoly. The Balance of Power
and the Community of Power&#8212;in other words,
the League of Nations&#8212;thus became the two rival
solutions of the problem of permanent peace.</p>


<h3>The Theory of Balance</h3>

<p>The discussion of their respective merits naturally
led to an inquiry into what the alternative
policies really meant. But inasmuch as the Foreign
Office committee found itself able to agree in
recommending some form of League of Nations,
the idea of the Balance of Power was not subjected
to so close a scrutiny or so searching an
analysis as would certainly have been the case
had the committee realised the possibility that
reaction against an imperfect League of Nations
might bring once more to the front the idea of
the Balance of Power. The fact was, however,
elicited that the Foreign Office conception of the
Balance of Power is a conception erroneously
supposed to have been expressed by Castlereagh
at the time of the Congress of Vienna, and adopted
as the leading principle of nineteenth century
British foreign policy.</p>

<p>Castlereagh was not, of course, the author of the
phrase or of the policy. The phrase can be found
before the end of the seventeenth century; and
in the eighteenth the policy was always pleaded
by potentates and Powers when on the defensive,
and ignored by them when in pursuit of honour or
<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a><span class="pagenum" title="24"></span>vital interests. But Castlereagh defined it afresh
after the colossal disturbance of the balance which
Napoleon effected; and he explained it as &#8220;a just
repartition of force amongst the States of Europe.&#8221;
They were, so to speak, to be rationed by common
agreement. There were to be five or six Great
Powers, whose independence was to be above
suspicion and whose strength was to be restrained
by the jealous watchfulness of one another. If
any one State, like France under Napoleon, grew
too powerful, all the rest were to combine to
restrain it.</p>

<p>Now, there is a good deal in common between
Castlereagh&#8217;s idea and that of the League of Nations.
Of course, there are obvious differences. Castlereagh&#8217;s
Powers were monarchies rather than peoples;
they were limited to Europe; little regard was
paid to smaller States, whose independence sometimes
rested on no better foundation than the
inability of the Great Powers to agree about their
absorption; and force rather than law or public
opinion was the basis of the scheme. But none of
these differences, important though they were,
between Castlereagh&#8217;s Balance of Power and the
League of Nations is so fundamental as the
difference between two things which are commonly
regarded as identical, viz., Castlereagh&#8217;s idea of the
Balance of Power and the meaning which has since
become attached to the phrase. There are at least
two senses in which it has been used, and the two
are wholly incompatible with one another. The
League of Nations in reality resembles Castlereagh&#8217;s
Balance of Power more closely than does the
<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a><span class="pagenum" title="25"></span>conventional notion of that balance; and a verbal
identity has concealed a real diversity to the
confusion of all political thought on the subject.</p>

<p>Castlereagh&#8217;s Balance of Power is what I believe
mathematicians call a multiple balance. It was not
like a pair of scales, in which you have only two
weights or forces balanced one against the other. It
was rather like a chandelier, in which you have five
or six different weights co-operating to produce a
general stability or equilibrium. In Castlereagh&#8217;s
scheme it would not much matter if one of the
weights were a little heavier than the others,
because there would be four or five of these others
to counterbalance it; and his assumption was
that these other Powers would naturally combine
for the purpose of redressing the balance and
preserving the peace. But a simple balance between
two opposing forces is a very different thing. If
there are only two, you have no combination on
which you can rely to counteract the increasing
power of either, and the slightest disturbance
suffices to upset the balance. Castlereagh&#8217;s whole
scheme therefore presupposed the continued and
permanent existence of some five or six great
Powers always preserving their independence in
foreign policy and war, and automatically acting
as a check upon the might and ambition of any
single State.</p>


<h3>The Change since Castlereagh</h3>

<p>Now, it was this condition, essential to the maintenance
of Castlereagh&#8217;s Balance of Power, which
<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a><span class="pagenum" title="26"></span>completely broke down during the course of the
nineteenth century. Like most of the vital processes
in history, the change was gradual and unobtrusive,
and its significance escaped the notice of politicians,
journalists, and even historians. Men went on
repeating Castlereagh&#8217;s phrases about the Balance
of Power without perceiving that the circumstances,
which alone had given it reality, had entirely
altered. The individual independence and automatic
action of the Great Powers in checking the growing
ambitions and strength of particular States were
impaired, if not destroyed, by separate Alliances,
which formed units into groups for the purposes
of war and foreign policy, and broke up the unity
of the European system, just as a similar tendency
threatens to break up the League of Nations.
There was a good deal of shifting about in
temporary alliances which there is no need to
recount; but the ultimate upshot was the severance
of Europe into the two great groups with which we
are all familiar, the Triple Alliance of Germany,
Austria, and Italy on one side, and the Triple
Entente between Russia, France, and Great Britain
on the other. The multiple Balance of Power was
thus changed into a simple balance between two
vast aggregations of force, and nothing remained
outside to hold the balance, except the United
States, which had apparently forsworn by the
Monroe Doctrine the function of keeping it
even.</p>

<p>And yet men continued to speak of the Balance
of Power as though there had been no change, and
as though Castlereagh&#8217;s ideas were as applicable
<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a><span class="pagenum" title="27"></span>to the novel situation as they had been to the old!
That illustrates the tyranny of phrases. Cynics
have said that language is used to conceal our
thoughts. It is difficult to resist the conclusion
that phrases are used to save us the trouble of
thinking. We are always giving things labels in
order to put them away in their appropriate pigeon-holes,
and then we talk about the labels without
thinking about them, and often forgetting (if we
ever knew) the things for which they stand. So
we Pelmanised the Balance of Power, and continued
to use the phrase without in the least troubling to
ask what it means. When I asked at the Foreign
Office whether diplomatists meant by the Balance
of Power the sort of simple balance between two
great alliances like the Triple Alliance and the
Triple Entente, I was told &#8220;yes&#8221;; and there was
some surprise&#8212;since the tradition of Castlereagh
is strong in the service&#8212;when I pointed out that
that was an entirely different balance from that
of which Castlereagh had approved as a guarantee
of peace. You remember the Cheshire cat in
<em>Alice in Wonderland</em>&#8212;an excellent text-book for
students of politics&#8212;and how the cat gradually
faded away leaving only its grin behind it to perplex
and puzzle the observer. So the body and the
substance of Castlereagh&#8217;s Balance of Power passed
away, and still men talk of the grin and look to the
phrase to save them from war. Whether to call
them visionaries or the blind, I do not know.</p>


<h3><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a><span class="pagenum" title="28"></span>Mischievous Hallucination</h3>

<p>In either case, it is a mischievous hallucination;
for the simple Balance of Power between two great
combinations is not only no guarantee of peace, but
the great begetter of fear, of the race for armaments,
and of war. Consider for a moment. If you want
a balance, you want to have it perfect. What is a
perfect balance between two opposing weights or
forces? It is one which the addition of a feather-weight
to either scale will at once and completely
upset. Now what will that equipoise produce?
The ease with which the balance may be destroyed
will produce either on one side the temptation to
upset it, and on the other fear lest it be upset, or
fear on both sides at once. What indeed was it but
this even balance and consequent fear which produced
the race for armaments? And what does the
race for armaments result in but in war? If we
want war, we need only aim at a Balance of
Power, and it will do the rest. So far from being
a guarantee of peace, the Balance of Power is a
sovereign specific for precipitating war.</p>

<p>Of course, there are arguments for a Balance of
Power. Plenty of them, alas! though they are not
often avowed. It produces other things than war.
For one thing, it makes fortunes for munition
firms. For another, it provides careers for those
who have a taste for fighting or for military pomp.
Thirdly, in order to maintain armies and navies
and armaments, it keeps up taxation and diverts
money from social, educational, and other reforms
<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a><span class="pagenum" title="29"></span>which some people want to postpone. Fourthly,
it gratifies those who believe that force is the ultimate
sanction of order, and, by necessitating the maintenance
of large forces for defensive purposes,
incidentally provides means for dealing with
domestic discontent. Fifthly, it panders to those
who talk of prestige and think that prestige depends
upon the size of a nation&#8217;s armaments. For the
sake of these things many would be willing to take
the risk of war which the Balance of Power involves.
But most of those who use the phrase are unconscious
of these motives, and use it as they use many
another phrase, simply because they know not
what it means. For, assuredly, no sane person
who had examined the Balance of Power, as it
existed before the war, could ever advocate it as
a means of peace.</p>

<p>Indeed, whenever there has been the prospect
of a practical Balance of Power, its votaries have
shown by their action that they knew their creed
was nonsense. The late war, for instance, might
have been ended in 1916 on the basis of a Balance
of Power. There were a few who believed that
that was the best solution; but they were not our
latter-day believers in the Balance of Power.
Their cry was all for a fight to a finish and a total
destruction of the Balance of Power by an overwhelming
victory for the Allies, and their one regret
is that a final blow by Marshal Foch did not destroy
the last vestige of a German army. What is the
point of expressing belief in the Balance of Power
when you indignantly repudiate your own doctrine
on every occasion on which you might be able to
<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a><span class="pagenum" title="30"></span>give it effect? And what is the point of the present
advocacy of the Balance of Power by those who
think themselves neither visionaries nor blind?
Do they wish to restore the military strength of
Germany and of Russia and to see an Alliance
between them confronting a Franco-British union,
compelled thereby to be militarist too? Is it
really that they wish to be militarists and that the
League of Nations, with its promise of peace,
retrenchment, and reform, is to them a greater
evil than the Balance of Power?</p>


<h3>Where the Line is Drawn</h3>

<p>There is yet another fatal objection to the Balance
of Power due to the change in circumstances since
the days of Castlereagh. He could afford to think
only of Europe, but we have to think of the world;
and if our specific has any value it must be of world-wide
application. We cannot proclaim the virtues
of the Balance of Power and then propose to limit
it to the land or to any particular continent. Now,
did our believers in the Balance of Power ever
wish to see power balanced anywhere else than on
the continent of Europe? That, if we studied
history in any other language than our own, we
should know was the gibe which other peoples flung
at our addiction to the Balance of Power. We
wanted, they said, to see a Balance of Power on the
continent of Europe, to see one half of Europe
equally matched against the other, because the
more anxiously Continental States were absorbed
in maintaining their Balance of Power, the keener
<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a><span class="pagenum" title="31"></span>would be their competition for our favour, and the
freer would be our hands to do what we liked in
the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Was that a baseless slander? Let us test it with
a question or two. Did we ever want a Balance
of Power at sea? British supremacy, with a
two-to-one or at least a sixteen-to-ten standard
was, I fancy, our minimum requirement. Is
British supremacy what we mean by a Balance of
Power? Again, did we ever desire a Balance of
Power in Africa, America, or Asia? We may have
talked of it sometimes, but only when we were the
weaker party and feared that another might claim
in those continents the sort of Balance of Power
we claimed on the sea. We never spoke of the
Balance of Power in the interests of any nation
except ourselves and an occasional ally. We
cannot speak in those terms to-day. If we demand
a Balance of Power on land, we must expect others
to claim it at sea; if we urge it on Europe as a
means of peace, we cannot object if others turn
our own argument against us in other quarters of
the globe; and wherever you have a Balance of
Power you will have a race for armaments and the
fear of war.</p>

<p>The Balance of Power is, in fact, becoming as
obsolete as the Monopoly of Power enjoyed by the
Roman Empire. It is a bankrupt policy which
went into liquidation in 1914, and the high court
of public opinion demands a reconstruction. The
principle of that reconstruction was stated by
President Wilson, a great seer whose ultimate
fame will survive the obloquy in which he has been
<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a><span class="pagenum" title="32"></span>involved by the exigencies of American party-politics
and the short-sightedness of public opinion
in Europe. We want, he said, a Community of
Power, and its organ must be the League of Nations.
Nations must begin to co-operate and cease to
counteract.</p>

<p>I am not advocating the League of Nations
except in the limited way of attempting to show
that the Balance of Power is impossible as an
alternative unless you can re-create the conditions
of a century ago, restore the individual independence
of a number of fairly equal Powers, and
guarantee the commonwealth of nations against
privy conspiracy and sedition in the form of separate
groups and alliances. But there is one supreme
advantage in a Community of Power, provided it
remains a reality, and that is that it need never
be used. Its mere existence would be sufficient to
ensure the peace; for no rebel State would care to
challenge the inevitable defeat and retribution
which a Community of Power could inflict. It
has even been urged, and I believe it myself, that
Germany would never have invaded Belgium had
she been sure that Great Britain, and still less had
she thought that America, would intervene. It
was the Balance of Power that provoked the war,
and it was the absence of a Community of Power
which made it possible.</p>


<h3>Basis of Security</h3>

<p>But no one who thinks that power&#8212;whether
a Monopoly, a Balance, or even a Community of
<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a><span class="pagenum" title="33"></span>Power is the ultimate guardian angel of our peace,
has the root of the matter in him. Men, said Burke,
are not governed primarily by laws, still less by force;
and behind all power stands opinion. To believe in
public opinion rather than in might excludes the
believer from the regular forces of militarism and
condemns him as a visionary and blind. For
advocates of the Balance of Power bear a striking
resemblance to the Potsdam school; and even so
moderate a German as the late Dr. Rathenau
declared in his unregenerate days before the war
that Germans were not in the habit of reckoning
with public opinion. Nevertheless, there is a frontier
in the world which for a century and more has
enjoyed a security which all the armaments of
Prussian militarism could not give the German
Fatherland; and the absolute security of that
frontier rests not upon a monopoly nor a community,
still less upon a balance of power, but on
the opinion held on both sides of that frontier that
all power is irrational and futile as a guarantee of
peace between civilised or Christian people.</p>

<p>Let us look at that frontier for a moment. It is
in its way the most wonderful thing on earth, and
it holds a light to lighten the nations and to guide
our feet into the way of peace. It runs, of course,
between the Dominion of Canada and the United
States of America across the great lakes and three
thousand miles of prairie; and from the military
and strategic point of view it is probably the worst
frontier in the world. Why then is it secure? Is
it because of any monopoly or community or
balance of power? Is it because the United States
<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><span class="pagenum" title="34"></span>and the British Empire are under a common government,
or because there is along that frontier a nicely-balanced
distribution of military strength? No, it
is secure, not in spite of the absence of force, but
because of the absence of force; and if you want
to destroy the peace of that frontier from end to
end, all you need to do is to send a regiment to
protect it, launch a <em>Dreadnought</em> on those lakes,
and establish a balance of power. For every
regiment or warship on one side will produce a
regiment or warship on the other; and then your
race for armaments will begin, and the poison
will spread until the whole of America becomes
like Europe, an armed camp of victims to the theory
of strategic frontiers and of the Balance of Power.</p>

<p>Those theories, their application, and their
consequences recently cost the world thirty million
casualties and thousands of millions of pounds
within a brief five years, and yet left the frontiers
of Europe less secure than they were before. Three
thousand miles of frontier in North America have
in more than a hundred years cost us hardly a life,
or a limb, or a penny. As we put those details
side by side we realise <em>quantula regitur mundus
sapientia</em>&#8212;with how little wisdom do men rule the
world. Yet the truth was told us long ago that he
that ruleth his spirit is better than he that taketh
a city, and we might have learnt by our experience
of the peace that the only conquest that really pays
is the conquest of oneself.</p>

<p>The real peace of that North American frontier
is due to no conquest of Americans by Canadians
or of Canadians by Americans, but to their conquest
<a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a><span class="pagenum" title="35"></span>of themselves and of that foolish pride of &#8220;heathen
folk who put their trust in reeking tube and iron
shard.&#8221; Let us face the facts, whatever the visionaries
and the blind may say. So be it. The war is
a fact, and so is the desolation it has wrought.
But that Anglo-American frontier is also a fact,
and so is that century of peace which happily
followed upon the resolution to depend for the
defence of that frontier on moral restraint instead
of on military force. Verily, peace hath her
victories not less renowned than those of war.</p>


<h3>The Alternative</h3>

<p>We have, indeed, to face the facts, and the facts
about the Balance of Power must dominate our deliberations
and determine the fate of our programmes.
There may be no more war for a generation, but
there can be no peace with a Balance of Power.
There can be nothing better than an armed truce;
and an armed truce, with super-dreadnoughts
costing from four to eight times what they did
before the war, is fatal to any programme of
retrenchment and reform. We are weighted enough
in all conscience with the debt of that war without
the burden of preparation for another; and a
Balance of Power involves a progressive increase
in preparations for war.</p>

<p>Unless we can exorcise fear, we are doomed to
repeat the sisyphean cycles of the past and painfully
roll our programmes up the hill, only to see them
dashed to the bottom, before we get to the top, by
the catastrophe of war. Fear is fatal to freedom;
<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a><span class="pagenum" title="36"></span>it is fear which alone gives militarism its strength,
compels nations to spend on armaments what
they fain would devote to social reform, drives
them into secret diplomacy and unnatural alliances,
and leads them to deny their just liberties to subject
populations. Fear is the root of reaction as faith
is the parent of progress; and the incarnation of
international fear is the Balance of Power.</p>

<h3>By Major-General Sir Frederick Maurice,
K.C.M.G., C.B.</h3>

<h4>Director of Military Operations&#8212;Imperial General Staff,
1915-16.</h4>


<p>Sir Frederick Maurice said:&#8212;This problem of
the reduction of armaments is one of the most urgent
of the international and national problems of the
day. It is urgent in its economic aspect, urgent
also as regards its relation to the future peace of
the world. The urgency of its economic aspect
was proclaimed two years ago at the Brussels
conference of financiers assembled by the League
of Nations. These experts said quite plainly and
definitely that, so far as they could see, the salvation
of Europe from bankruptcy depended upon the
immediate diminution of the crushing burden of
expenditure upon arms. That was two years ago.
Linked up with this question is the whole question
of the economic reconstruction of Europe. Linked
up with it also is that deep and grave problem of
reparations. It is no longer the case to-day, if it
has ever been the case since the war, which I doubt,
that sober opinion in France considers it necessary
for France to have large military forces in order to
protect her from German aggression in the near
future. For the past two years, however, it has
been the custom of those who live upon alarms
<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a><span class="pagenum" title="38"></span>to produce the German menace. There is a great
body of opinion in France at this moment which
feels that unless France is able to put the pistol to
Germany&#8217;s head, it will never be able to get a
penny out of Germany.</p>

<p>You have the further connection of the attitude
of America to the problem. America said, officially
through Mr. Hoover and unofficially through a
number of her leading financiers, that she was not
ready to come forward and take her share in the
economic restoration of Europe so long as Europe
is squandering its resources upon arms. The
connection is quite definitely and explicitly recognised
in the Covenant of the League of Nations.
Article 8 begins: &#8220;The principles of the League
recognise that the maintenance of peace requires
reduction of national armaments to the lowest
point consistent with national safety, and the
enforcement by common action of international
obligations.&#8221; These words were promulgated in
1919. Personally, I find myself in complete agreement
with what Lord Robert Cecil said this morning,
and what Lord Grey said a few days ago at Newcastle,
that one of the prime causes of the war was
Prussian militarism. By that I mean the influence
of that tremendous military machine, which had
been built up through years of labour in Germany,
in moulding the public opinion of that
country.</p>


<h3><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a><span class="pagenum" title="39"></span>A Group of New Armies</h3>

<p>Well, how do we stand in regard to that to-day?
We stand to-day in the position that the armaments
of Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, have all
been compulsorily drastically reduced, but in their
place you have a whole group of new armies. You
have armies to-day which did not exist before the
war, in Finland, Esthonia, Poland, Lithuania, and
Czecho-Slovakia, and the sum total is that at this
moment there are more armed men in time of
peace in Europe than in 1913. Is there no danger
that this machine will mould the minds of some
other peoples, just as the German machine moulded
the minds of the Germans? This is the position
as regards the peace establishments of Europe
to-day in their relation to the future peace of the
world. What about the economic position? I
have mentioned that certain Powers have had
their forces drastically reduced, and that has
brought with it a drastic reduction of expenditure,
but I have before me the naval, military, and air
force estimates of the eight principal Powers in
Europe, leaving out Germany, Austria, and Bulgaria,
whose forces have been compulsorily reduced.</p>

<p>At the economic conference of financiers in
Brussels in 1920 it was mentioned with horror
that 20 per cent. of the income of Europe was
then being devoted to arms. I find that to-day
25 per cent. of the total income of these eight
Powers is devoted to arms. I find, further, that of
these eight Powers who have budgeted for a smaller
<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a><span class="pagenum" title="40"></span>service, only one&#8212;Yugo-Slavia&#8212;has managed to
balance her budget, and the others have large deficits
which are many times covered by their expenditure
on arms. And this is going on at a time when all
these eight nations are taxed almost up to their
limit, when the whole of their industries are suffering
in consequence, and when the danger of bankruptcy,
which horrified the financiers in 1920, is even more
imminent.</p>

<p>That being the case, what has been done in the
last few years to remedy this matter, and why is
more not being done? As you all know, this
question is in the forefront of the programme of the
League of Nations. And the League began to deal
with it at once. Lord Robert Cecil will agree with
me that the framers of the Covenant, of which he
is one of the chief, could not foresee everything,
and they did not foresee at the time the Covenant
was framed, that machinery would be required to
deal with this extraordinarily complex question of
armaments. They created an organisation then
called a Permanent Military Command, still in
existence, to advise the Council of the League on
all military matters. But when these gentlemen
got to work upon such questions as reduction of
armaments, they at once found themselves dealing
with matters entirely beyond their competence,
because into this problem enter problems of high
politics and finance, and a thousand other questions
of which soldiers, sailors, and airmen know nothing
whatever.</p>


<h3><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a><span class="pagenum" title="41"></span>The League&#8217;s Commission</h3>

<p>The first step was to remedy an oversight in the
machinery, and that was done at the first meeting
of the Assembly. The first meeting of the Assembly
created a temporary mixed commission on armaments,
which was composed of persons of recognised
competence in political, social, and economic matters.
It consisted of six members of the old Permanent
Commission, and in addition a number of statesmen,
employers, and representatives of labour.
This body started to tackle this grave question.
Before it began the first Assembly of the
League had suggested one line of approach&#8212;that
there should be an agreement to limit expenditure;
that an attempt should be made to limit armaments
by limiting budgets; and nations were asked to
agree that they would not exceed in the two years
following the acceptance of the resolution the
budgeted expenditure on armaments of the current
year.</p>

<p>That proposal did not meet with great success.
It was turned down by seven Powers, notably by
France and Spain. On the whole, I think France
and Spain and the other Powers had some reason
on their side, because it is not possible to approach
this problem solely from the financial standpoint.
You cannot get a financial common denominator
and apply it to armaments. The varying costs of
a soldier in Europe and in Japan have no relation
to each other. The cost of a voluntary soldier in
Great Britain has no relation to the cost of a
<a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a><span class="pagenum" title="42"></span>conscript on the Continent. Therefore, that line
of approach, when applied too broadly, is not
fruitful. I think myself it is quite possible that
you may be able to apply financial limitations to
the question of material, the construction of guns
and other weapons of war, because the cost of these
things in foreign countries tends much more to a
common level. I think this is a possible line of
approach, but to try to make a reduction of armaments
by reducing budgets on a wholesale scale
I do not think will lead us anywhere at all. I may
safely say that for the present that line of approach
has been abandoned.</p>

<p>The Temporary Mixed Commission got to work,
and in its first year, frankly, I cannot say it did
very much. It concerned itself very largely with
the accumulation of information and the collection
of statistics, bearing rather the same relation to
world problems as a Royal Commission does to our
domestic problems. By the time the second
Assembly met practically nothing had been done
by the Commission. But other people had been at
work, and our own League of Nations Union had
put forward a proposal&#8212;a line of approach, rather,
I would say, to this problem&#8212;which I for one think
is extremely useful. It began by inquiring as to
what armaments were for, which after all is a useful
way of beginning, and the inquiry came to the
conclusion that nations required them for three
purposes&#8212;to maintain internal order; as a last
resort for the enforcement of law and order; and
to protect overseas possessions. After these purposes
were served there was a large residuum left. That
<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a><span class="pagenum" title="43"></span>residuum could only be required for one purpose&#8212;to
protect the country in question from foreign
aggression. When you had gone thus far in your
reasoning, you had obviously got into the zone
where bargaining becomes possible, because it is
obvious that by agreement you can get the force
by which a nation is liable to become reduced.
That line of approach received the general blessing
at the second Assembly of the League of Nations.
Things began to move, primarily because the
Dominion of South Africa took a keen interest in
this problem of the reduction of armaments, and
South Africa appointed Lord Robert Cecil as its
representative, and instructed him to press the
matter on, and he did. The Assembly definitely
instructed this temporary mixed Commission that
by the time the third Assembly met plans should
be prepared and concrete proposals put on paper.</p>


<h3>Washington</h3>

<p>Soon after that came the Washington Conference&#8212;a
great landmark in the history of this problem.
For reasons I need not go into in detail, the naval
problem is very much easier than the military or
air problem. You have as the nucleus of naval
forces something quite definite and precise&#8212;the
battleship&#8212;and it also happens that that particular
unit is extremely costly, and takes a long time to
build, and no man has yet ever succeeded in concealing
the existence of a battleship. There you
had three important points&#8212;a large and important
unit in the possession of everybody concerned,
<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a><span class="pagenum" title="44"></span>very costly, so that by reducing it you make great
reductions in expenditure. There was no possibility
of avoiding an agreement about the construction
of battleships, and it is to these facts mainly that
the happy results of the Washington Conference
were due.</p>

<p>But for the furtherance of the problem the point
is this. The Washington Conference definitely
established the principle of reduction of armaments
on a great ratio. The ratio for battleships between
Great Britain, the United States, Japan, France,
and Italy, was settled as to 5, 5, 3, and 1.75. They
all agreed on a definite ratio. All agreed to scrap
a certain number of ships, to bring their tonnage
down to a certain figure, and by doing that
relatively they were left in the same position as
before, with this advantage&#8212;that they at once
obtained an enormous reduction in expenditure on
armaments.</p>

<p>That opened up a new line of approach for the
attack on this problem from the military and air
standpoint. And the next development took place
in February this year at the meeting of the Temporary
Mixed Commission on armaments, when the
Esher proposals were presented. There has been
a great deal of talk about the Esher proposals, and
I am glad of it, because the one thing wanted in
this question is public interest. The Esher proposals
were an endeavour to apply to land armaments this
principle of reduction on a great ratio. And the
line taken was this. It was necessary to find some
unit in land armaments which corresponded with
the battleships, and the unit selected by Lord
<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a><span class="pagenum" title="45"></span>Esher was the 300,000 regular soldiers of the peace
armies in France, England, and Spain. It was
selected because it happened to be the number to
which the Austrian army was reduced by treaty,
and with that unit he proposed a ratio for the
armies of Europe, which would leave everybody
relatively in much the same position as before, but
would obtain an immediate reduction in numbers
of standing armies and a great reduction of expenditure.</p>

<p>This proposal was subjected to a great deal of
criticism, and I am sorry to say nine-tenths of the
criticism appears to emanate from persons who
have never read the proposal at all. It is a proposal
which lends itself to a great deal of criticism, and
the most effective criticism which could have been
applied at the time it was presented was that it
put the cart before the horse, and approached the
problem from the wrong direction, for, as Lord
Robert Cecil has said here this morning, what
nations require is security. Some of them have
clear ideas as to the way of obtaining it, but they
all want it, and before you can expect people to
reduce their armaments, which are, after all,
maintained mainly for the purpose of providing
security, you must give them something that will
take the place of armaments.</p>


<h3>A General Defensive Pact</h3>

<p>In June an important development took place
in this Temporary Commission. It was increased
by the addition of a number of statesmen, and,
<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a><span class="pagenum" title="46"></span>amongst others, of men who ought to have been
on it long ago. Lord Robert Cecil was added, and
he at once proceeded to remedy what was a real
difficulty in Lord Esher&#8217;s proposals. He put forward
a plan for providing security in the form, as the
Assembly of the League had asked, of a definite
written proposal&#8212;really a brief treaty. The
purport of that treaty is included in the form of
resolutions, which are roughly as follows:&#8212;No
scheme for the reduction of armaments can be
effective unless it is general; that in the present
state of the world no Government can accept the
responsibility for a serious reduction of armaments
unless it is given some other equally satisfactory
guarantee of the safety of its country; such
guarantee can only be found in a general defensive
agreement of all the countries concerned, binding
them all to come to the assistance of any one of
them if attacked.</p>

<p>A general defensive pact, with a proviso! It is
obviously unreasonable to expect the States of the
American continent to be ready to come over at
any moment to help in Europe. It is obviously
unreasonable to expect the States of Europe to
bind themselves to come and fight in Asia. Therefore,
there was this proviso added that an obligation
to come to the assistance of the attacked country
should be limited to those countries which belonged
to the same quarter of the globe. Thus, you see,
you are getting the obligation of the League into
regional application. Personally my own conviction
is that this is the line upon which many
of the functions of the League will develop.</p>

<p><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a><span class="pagenum" title="47"></span>The main point of the situation as it is to-day
is that you have got a committee working out in
detail a general pact, which when it is formulated
will be far more complete and satisfactory than
the very general and vague Clause 10 of the
Covenant. We have reached the position when
practical proposals are beginning to emerge.
What more is wanted? How can we help on this
work? You will have gathered from what I said
that it is my own conviction that with this problem
of reduction of armaments is so closely linked
up the problem of economic reconstruction and
reparations that the whole ought to be taken
together. I believe one of the reasons why so little
progress has been made is that the economic
problems have been entrusted, with the blessing
of our and other Governments, to perambulating
conferences, while the disarmament problem has
been left solely to the League of Nations. I believe
if you could get the whole of these problems
considered by one authority&#8212;and there is one
obvious authority&#8212;progress would be far more
rapid.</p>

<p>There is another matter which concerns us as
citizens&#8212;the attitude of our own Government to
this question. I was delighted to see recently an
announcement made by a Minister in the House
of Commons that the Government was seriously
in favour of a reduction of armaments on a great
ratio. I was delighted to read the other day a
speech, to which reference has already been made,
by the Prime Minister. We have had a great many
words on this question. The time has come for
<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a><span class="pagenum" title="48"></span>action, and quite frankly the action of our Government
in the past two years with regard to this
question has been neutral, and not always one of
benevolent neutrality. Our official representatives
at Geneva have been very careful to stress the
difficulties, but up to the present I am unaware
that our Government has ever placed its immense
resources as regards information at the disposal of
the one Englishman who has been striving with all
his power and knowledge to get a definite solution.
I believe there is going to be a change; I hope so.
In any case, the best thing we can do is to see that
it is changed, and that Lord Robert Cecil is not left
to fight a lone battle.</p>


<h3>The Appeal to Public Opinion</h3>

<p>There is something more. There is something
wanted from each of us. Personally, I am convinced
myself that this problem is soluble on the lines by
which it is now being approached. I speak to you
as a professional who has given some study to the
subject. I am convinced that on the lines of a
general pact as opposed to the particular pact, a
general defensive agreement as opposed to separate
alliances, followed by reduction on a great ratio,
the practicability of which has been proved at
Washington, a solution can be reached. Given
goodwill&#8212;that is the point. At the last Assembly
of the League of Nations a report was presented
by the Commission, of which Lord Robert Cecil
was a member, and it wound up with these words:
&#8220;Finally, the committee recognises that a policy
<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a><span class="pagenum" title="49"></span>of disarmament, to be successful, requires the
support of the population of the world. Limitation
of armaments will never be imposed by Governments
on peoples, but it may be imposed by peoples
on Governments.&#8220; That is absolutely true. How
are we going to apply it? Frankly, myself, I do
not see that there is a great deal of value to be
got by demonstrations which demand no more war.
I have every sympathy with their object, but we
have got to the stage when we want to get beyond
words to practical resolutions. We want definite
concrete proposals, and you won&#8217;t get these merely
by demonstrations. They are quite good in their
way, but they are not enough. What you want
in this matter is an informed public opinion
which sees what is practical and insists on
having it.</p>

<p>I am speaking to you as one who for a great
many years believed absolutely that preparation
for war was the means of securing peace. In 1919&#8212;when
I had a little time to look round, to study
the causes of the war and the events of the war&#8212;I
changed my opinion. I then came quite definitely
to the conclusion that preparation for war, carried
to the point to which it had been carried in 1914,
was a direct cause of war. I had to find another path,
and I found it in 1919. Lord Robert may possibly
remember that in the early days of the Peace
Conference I came to him and made my confession
of faith, and I promised to give him what little
help I could. I have tried to keep my promise, and
I believe this vital problem, upon which not only
the economic reconstruction of Europe and the
<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a><span class="pagenum" title="50"></span>future peace of the world, but also social development
at home depend, can be solved provided you
will recognise that the problem is very complex;
that there is fear to be overcome; that you are
content with what is practical from day to day,
and accept each practical step provided it leads
forward to the desired goal. I therefore most
earnestly trust that the Liberal party will take
this question up, and translate it into practical
politics. For that is what is required.</p>

DEBT</h2>

<h3>By John Maynard Keynes</h3>

<h4>M.A., C.B.; Fellow of King&#8217;s College, Cambridge; Editor
of <em>Economic Journal</em> since 1912; principal representative
of the Treasury at the Paris Peace Conference,
and Deputy for the Chancellor of the Exchequer on
the Supreme Economic Council, Jan.-June, 1919.</h4>


<p>Mr. Keynes said:&#8212;I do not complain of Lord
Balfour&#8217;s Note, provided we assume, as I think
we can, that it is our first move, and not our last.
Many people seem to regard it as being really
addressed to the United States. I do not agree.
Essentially it is addressed to France. It is a reply,
and a very necessary reply, to the kites which M.
Poincar&eacute; has been flying in <em>The Times</em> and elsewhere,
suggesting that this country should sacrifice
all its claims of every description in return for&#8212;practically
nothing at all, certainly not a permanent
solution of the general problem. The Note brings
us back to the facts and to the proper starting-point
for negotiations.</p>

<p>In this question of Reparations the position
changes so fast that it may be worth while for me
to remind you just how the question stands at
this moment. There are in existence two inconsistent
settlements, both of which still hold good
in law. The first is the assessment of the Reparation
<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a><span class="pagenum" title="52"></span>Commission, namely, 132 milliard gold marks.
This is a capital sum. The second is the London
Settlement, which is not a capital sum at all, but
a schedule of annual payments calculated according
to a formula; but the capitalised value of these
annual payments, worked out on any reasonable
hypothesis, comes to much less than the Reparation
Commission&#8217;s total, probably to not much more
than a half.</p>


<h3>The Breakdown of Germany</h3>

<p>But that is not the end of the story. While both
the above settlements remain in force, the temporary
r&eacute;gime under which Germany has been paying is
different from, and much less than, either of them.
By a decision of last March Germany was to pay
during 1922 &pound;36,000,000 (gold) in cash, <em>plus</em>
deliveries in kind. The value of the latter cannot
be exactly calculated, but, apart from coal, they
do not amount to much, with the result that the
1922 demands are probably between a third and a
quarter of the London Settlement, and less than
one-sixth of the Reparation Commission&#8217;s original
total. It is under the weight of this reduced burden
that Germany has now broken down, and the
present crisis is due to her inability to continue
these reduced instalments beyond the payment of
July, 1922. In the long run the payments due
during 1922 should be within Germany&#8217;s capacity.
But the insensate policy pursued by the Allies for
the last four years has so completely ruined her
finances, that for the time being she can pay nothing
<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a><span class="pagenum" title="53"></span>at all; and for a shorter or longer period it is certain
that there is now no alternative to a moratorium.</p>

<p>What, in these circumstances, does M. Poincar&eacute;
propose? To judge from the semi-official forecasts,
he is prepared to cancel what are known as the
&#8220;C&#8221; Bonds, provided Great Britain lets France
off the whole of her debt and forgoes her own
claims to Reparation. What are these &#8220;C&#8221; Bonds?
They are a part of the London Settlement of May,
1921, and, roughly speaking, they may be said to
represent the excess of the Reparation Commission&#8217;s
assessment over the capitalised value of the London
Schedule of Payments, and a bit more. That is to
say, they are pure water. They mainly represent
that part of the Reparation Commission&#8217;s total
assessment which will not be covered, even though
the London Schedule of Payments is paid in full.</p>

<p>In offering the cancellation of these Bonds,
therefore, M. Poincar&eacute; is offering exactly nothing.
If Great Britain gave up her own claims to Reparations,
and the &#8220;C&#8221; Bonds were cancelled to the
extent of France&#8217;s indebtedness to us, France&#8217;s
claims against Germany would be actually greater,
even on paper, than they are now. For the demands
under the London Settlement would be unabated,
and France would be entitled to a larger proportion
of them. The offer is, therefore, derisory. And
it seems to me to be little short of criminal on the
part of <em>The Times</em> to endeavour to trick the people
of this country into such a settlement.</p>

<p>Personally, I do not think that at this juncture
there is anything whatever to be done except to
grant a moratorium. It is out of the question
<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a><span class="pagenum" title="54"></span>that any figure, low enough to do Germany&#8217;s credit
any good now, could be acceptable to M. Poincar&eacute;,
in however moderate a mood he may visit London
next week. Apart from which, it is really impossible
at the present moment for any one to say how
much Germany will be able to pay in the long run.
Let us content ourselves, therefore, with a moratorium
for the moment, and put off till next year
the discussion of a final settlement, when, with
proper preparations beforehand, there ought to be
a grand Conference on the whole connected problem
of inter-Governmental debt, with representatives
of the United States present, and possibly at
Washington.</p>


<h3>The Illusion of a Loan</h3>

<p>The difficulties in the way of any immediate
settlement now are so obvious that one might
wonder why any one should be in favour of the
attempt. The explanation lies in that popular
illusion, with which it now pleases the world
to deceive itself&#8212;the International Loan. It is
thought that if Germany&#8217;s liability can now be
settled once and for all, the &#8220;bankers&#8221; will then
lend her a huge sum of money by which she can
anticipate her liabilities and satisfy the requirements
of France.</p>

<p>In my opinion the International Loan on a great
scale is just as big an illusion as Reparations on a
great scale. It will not happen. It cannot happen.
And it would make a most disastrous disturbance
if it did happen. The idea that the rest of the
<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a><span class="pagenum" title="55"></span>world is going to lend to Germany, for her to
hand over to France, about 100 per cent. of their
liquid savings&#8212;for that is what it amounts to&#8212;is
utterly preposterous. And the sooner we get that
into our heads the better. I am not quite clear
for what sort of an amount the public imagine
that the loan would be, but I think the sums
generally mentioned vary from &pound;250,000,000 up to
&pound;500,000,000. The idea that any Government in
the world, or all of the Governments in the world
in combination, let alone bankrupt Germany,
could at the present time raise this amount of new
money (that is to say, for other purposes than the
funding or redemption of existing obligations)
from investors in the world&#8217;s Stock Exchanges is
ridiculous.</p>

<p>The highest figure which I have heard mentioned
by a reliable authority is &pound;100,000,000. Personally,
I think even this much too high. It could only be
realised if subscriptions from special quarters, as,
for example, German hoards abroad, and German-Americans,
were to provide the greater part of it,
which would only be the case if it were part of a
settlement which was of great and obvious advantage
to Germany. A loan to Germany, on Germany&#8217;s
own credit, yielding, say, 8 to 10 per cent., would
not in my opinion be an investor&#8217;s proposition in
any part of the world, except on a most trifling
scale. I do not mean that a larger anticipatory
loan of a different character&#8212;issued, for example,
in Allied countries with the guarantees of the Allied
Government, the proceeds in each such country
being handed over to the guaranteeing Government,
<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a><span class="pagenum" title="56"></span>so that no new money would pass&#8212;might not be
possible. But a loan of this kind is not at present
in question.</p>

<p>Yet a loan of from &pound;50,000,000 to &pound;100,000,000&#8212;and
I repeat that even this figure is very optimistic
except as the result of a settlement of a kind which
engaged the active goodwill of individual Germans
with foreign resources and of foreigners of German
origin and sympathies&#8212;would only cover Germany&#8217;s
liabilities under the London Schedule for four to
six months, and the temporarily reduced payments
of last March for little more than a year. And
from such a loan, after meeting Belgian priorities
and Army of Occupation costs, there would not be
left any important sum for France.</p>

<p>I see no possibility, therefore, of any final settlement
with M. Poincar&eacute; in the immediate future.
He has now reached the point of saying that he is
prepared to talk sense in return for an enormous
bribe, and that is some progress. But as no one is
in a position to offer him the bribe, it is not much
progress, and as the force of events will compel
him to talk sense sooner or later, even without a
bribe, his bargaining position is not strong. In
the meantime he may make trouble. If so, it can&#8217;t
be helped. But it will do him no good, and may
even help to bring nearer the inevitable day of
disillusion. I may add that for France to agree to
a short moratorium is not a great sacrifice since,
on account of the Belgian priority and other items,
the amount of cash to which France will be entitled
in the near future, even if the payments fixed last
March were to be paid in full, is quite trifling.</p>


<h3><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a><span class="pagenum" title="57"></span>A Policy for the Liberal Party</h3>

<p>So much for the immediate situation and the
politics of the case. If we look forward a little, I
venture to think that there is a clear, simple, and
practical policy for the Liberal Party to adopt and
to persist in. Both M. Poincar&eacute; and Mr. Lloyd
George have their hands tied by their past utterances.
Mr. Lloyd George&#8217;s part in the matter of
Reparations is the most discreditable episode in
his career. It is not easy for him, whose hands
are not clean in the matter, to give us a clean
settlement. I say this although his present
intentions appear to be reasonable. All the
more reason why others should pronounce and
persist in a clear and decided policy. I was
disappointed, if I may say so, in what Lord Grey
had to say about this at Newcastle last week.
He said many wise things, but not a word of
constructive policy which could get any one an
inch further forward. He seemed to think that all
that was necessary was to talk to the French
sympathetically and to put our trust in international
bankers. He puts a faith in an international loan
as the means of solution which I am sure is not
justified. We must be much more concrete than
that, and we must be prepared to say unpleasant
things as well as pleasant ones.</p>

<p>The right solution, the solution that we are
bound to come to in the end, is not complicated.
We must abandon the claim for pensions and bring
to an end the occupation of the Rhinelands. The
<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a><span class="pagenum" title="58"></span>Reparation Commission must be asked to divide
their assessment into two parts&#8212;the part that
represents pensions and separation allowances
and the rest. And with the abandonment of the
former the proportion due to France would be
correspondingly raised. If France would agree to
this&#8212;which is in her interest, anyhow&#8212;and would
terminate the occupation it would be right for
us to forgive her (and our other Allies) all they owe
us, and to accord a priority on all receipts in favour
of the devastated areas. If we could secure a real
settlement by these sacrifices, I think we should
make them completely regardless of what the
United States may say or do.</p>

<p>In declaring for this policy in the House of
Commons yesterday, Mr. Asquith has given the
Liberal Party a clear lead. I hope that they will
make it a principal plank in their platform. This
is a just and honourable settlement, satisfactory
to sentiment and to expediency. Those who
adopt it unequivocally will find that they have
with them the tide and a favouring wind. But no
one must suppose that, even with such a settlement,
any important part of Germany&#8217;s payments can
be anticipated by a loan. Any small loan that can
be raised will be required for Germany herself, to
put her on her legs again, and enable her to make
the necessary annual payments.</p>

FINANCE</h2>

<h3>By Sir Josiah Stamp, K.B.E., D.Sc.</h3>

<h4>Assistant Secretary Board of Inland Revenue, 1916-19.
Member of Royal Commission on Income Tax, 1919.</h4>


<p>Sir Josiah Stamp said:&#8212;In discussing the problem
of National Finance we have to decide which
problem we mean, viz., the &#8220;short period&#8221; or
the &#8220;long period,&#8221; for there are distinctly two
issues. I can, perhaps, illustrate it best by the
analogy of the household in which the chief earner
or the head of the family has been stricken down
by illness. It may be that a heavy doctor&#8217;s bill
or surgeon&#8217;s fee has to be met, and that this
represents a serious burden and involves the
strictest economy for a year or two; that all
members of the household forgo some luxuries, and
that there is a cessation of saving and perhaps
a &#8220;cut&#8221; into some past accumulations. But once
these heroic measures have been taken and the
burden lifted, and the chief earner resumes his
occupation, things proceed on the same scale and
plan as before. It may be, however, that the
illness or operation permanently impairs his earning
power, and that the changes which have to be made
must be more drastic and permanent. Then
perhaps would come an alteration of the whole
ground plan of the life of that family, the removal
<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a><span class="pagenum" title="60"></span>to a smaller house with lower standing charges
and a changed standard of living. What I call the
&#8220;short period&#8221; problem involves a view only of
the current year and the immediate future for the
purpose of ascertaining whether we can make
ends meet by temporary self-denial. What I term
the &#8220;long distance&#8221; problem involves an examination
of the whole scale upon which our future
outlay is conditioned for us.</p>

<p>The limit of further economies on the lines of
the &#8220;Geddes&#8217; cut&#8221; that can become effective in
1923, would seem to be some 50 or 60 millions,
because every 10 per cent. in economy represents
a much more drastic and difficult task than the
preceding, and it cuts more deeply into your
essential national services. On the other side of
the account one sees the probable revenue diminish
to an almost similar extent, having regard to the
effect of reductions in the rate of tax and the
depression in trade, with a lower scale of profits,
brought about by a lower price level, entering
into the income-tax average. It looks as though
1923 may just pay its way, but if so, then, like
the current year, it will make no contribution
towards the reduction of the debt. So much for
the &#8220;short period.&#8221; Our worst difficulties are
really going to be deep-seated ones.</p>


<h3>The Two Parts of a Budget</h3>

<p>Now a national budget may consist of two parts,
one of which I will call the &#8220;responsive&#8221; and the
<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a><span class="pagenum" title="61"></span>other the &#8220;non-responsive&#8221; portion. The responsive
portion is the part that may be expected to
answer sooner or later&#8212;later perhaps rather than
sooner&#8212;to alterations in general conditions, and
particularly to price alterations. If there is a very
marked difference in general price level, the salaries&#8212;both
by the addition or remission of bonuses and
the general alteration in scales for new entrants&#8212;may
be expected to alter, at any rate, in the same
direction, and that part of the expense which
consists of the purchase of materials will also be
responsive. The second, or non-responsive part,
is the part that has a fixed expression in currency,
and does not alter with changed conditions. This,
for the most part, is the capital and interest for the
public debt.</p>

<p>Now the nature and gravity of the &#8220;long
distance&#8221; problem is almost entirely a question of
the proportions which these two sections bear to
each other. If the non-responsive portion is a
small percentage of the total the problem will not
be important, but if it is larger, then the question
must be faced seriously. Suppose, for example,
that you have now a total budget of 900 million
pounds, and that, in the course of time, all values
are expressed at half the present currency figure.
Imagine that the national income in this instance
is 3600 million pounds. Then the burden, on a
first approximation, is 25 per cent. Now, if the
whole budget is responsive, we may find it ultimately
at 450 million pounds out of a national income of
1800 million pounds, <em>i.e.</em> still 25 per cent. But let
the non-responsive portion be 400 million pounds,
<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a><span class="pagenum" title="62"></span>then your total budget will be 650 million pounds
out of a national income of about 2000 million
pounds, or 33-1/3 per cent., and every alteration in
prices&#8212;or what we call &#8220;improvement&#8221; in the
cost of living&#8212;becomes an extraordinarily serious
matter as a burden upon new enterprise in the
future.</p>

<p>Let me give you a homely and familiar illustration.
During the war the nation has borrowed
something that is equivalent to a pair of boots.
When the time comes for paying back the loan it
repays something which is equivalent to two pairs
or, possibly, even to three pairs. If the total number
of boots produced has not altered, you will see
what an increasing &#8220;pull&#8221; this is upon production.
There are, of course, two ways in which this increasing
pull&#8212;while a great boon to the person
who is being repaid&#8212;must be an increased burden
to the individual. Firstly, if the number of people
making boots increases substantially, it may still
be only one pair of boots for the same volume
of production, if the burden is spread over
that larger volume. Secondly, even supposing
that the number of individuals is not increased, if
the arts of production have so improved that two
pairs can be produced with the same effort as was
formerly necessary for one, then the debt may be
repaid by them without the burden being actually
heavier than before.</p>

<p>Now, coming back to the general problem. The
two ways in which the alteration in price level
can be prevented from resulting in a heavier individual
burden than existed at the time when the
<a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a><span class="pagenum" title="63"></span>transaction was begun, are a large increase in the
population with no lower average wealth, or a
large increase in wealth with the same population&#8212;which
involves a greatly increased dividend
from our complex modern social organism with all
its mechanical, financial, and other differentiated
functions. Of course, some of the debt burden is
responsive, so far as the annual charge is concerned,
on that part of the floating debt which is reborrowed
continually at rates of interest which follow current
money rates, but, even so, the burden of capital
repayment remains. An opportunity occurs for
putting sections of the debt upon a lower annual
charge basis whenever particular loans come to
maturity, and there may be some considerable
relief in the annual charge in the course of time by
this method.</p>

<p>What are the prospects of the two methods that
I have mentioned coming to our rescue in this
&#8220;long distance&#8221; problem? It is a problem to
which our present &#8220;short distance&#8221; contribution
is, you will admit, a very poor one, for we have not
so far really made any substantial contribution
from current revenue towards the repayment of
the debt.</p>


<h3>A Century of the National Debt</h3>

<p>Historical surveys and parallels are notoriously
risky, particularly where the conditions have no
precedent. They ought, however, to be made,
provided that we keep our generalisations from
them under careful control. Now, after the
<a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a><span class="pagenum" title="64"></span>Napoleonic wars we had a national debt somewhat
comparable in magnitude in its relation to the
national wealth and income with the present debt.
What happened to that as a burden during the 100
years just gone by? If it was alleviated, to what
was the alleviation due? I would not burden you
with a mass of figures, but I would just give you
one or two selected periods. You can find more
details in my recent book on <em>Wealth and Taxable
Capacity</em>. We had a total debt of&#8212;</p>

<table summary="Debt 1817-1903" title="Debt 1817-1903">

<p class="noind">and before this last war it had been reduced to
707 million pounds. In 1920, of course, it was over
8000 million pounds. Such incidents as the Crimean
and the Boer wars added materially to the debt,
but apart therefrom you will see that there is no
tremendous relief by way of capital repayment
to the original debt. Similarly, in a hundred years,
even if we have no big wars, it is quite possible
we may have additions to the national debt from
smaller causes. Yet the volume of the debt per
head fell from &pound;50 to &pound;15.7, so you will see that the
increasing population made an enormous difference.
The real burden of the debt is of course felt mainly
in its annual charge. I will take this, therefore,
rather than the capital:&#8212;</p>

<table summary="Debt Charge 1817-1857" title="Debt Charge 1817-1857">

<tr><td>&quot;</td><td>1914</td><td>&quot;</td><td>&quot;</td><td>&quot;</td><td>24</td><td>&quot;</td><td>&quot;</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="noind">Here you will see that the reduction from 32 to 24
was 25 per cent. or a much greater reduction than
the reduction of the <em>total</em> capital debt, and this, of
course, was contributed to by the lower rates of
interest which had been brought about from time
to time. When we take the annual charge per
head the fall is much more striking. In the hundred
years it decreased from 37s. to 10s. This, however,
was a money reduction, and the <em>real</em> burden per
head can only be judged after we have considered
what the purchasing power of that money was.
Now, the charge per head, reduced to a common
basis of purchasing power, fell as follows:&#8212;</p>

<table summary="Index figure 1817-1914" title="Index figure 1817-1914">
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Index figure</td></tr>
<tr><td>1817</td><td>260</td></tr>
<tr><td>1842</td><td>242</td></tr>
<tr><td>1857</td><td>191</td></tr>
<tr><td>1895</td><td>210</td></tr>
<tr><td>1914</td><td>118</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="noind">In the year 1920 the charge per head was &pound;7.16
and my purchasing power index figure 629. You
will see that the <em>real</em> burden in commodities moved
down much less violently than the <em>money</em> burden,
and the relief was not actually so great as it looks,
because prices were far lower in 1914 than they
were early in the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that our debt is approximately
ten times that of the last century, let us ask
ourselves the broad question: &#8220;Can we look
forward to nothing better than the reduction of
<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a><span class="pagenum" title="66"></span>our debt by 450 millions in thirty-seven
years?&#8221;</p>

<p>The nineteenth century was one long contest
between two opposing forces. The increase in
the population, together with the power to make
wealth, were together enormously effective in
decreasing the burden. Against them was the
ultimate tendency to lower prices, and the former
of these two forces slowly won the day.</p>

<p>I hesitate to say that we can expect anything at
all comparable with the wonderful leap forward in
productive power during the early Victorian era. I
hope that in this I may prove to be wrong. Anyway
I do not think that in our lifetime we can
expect these islands to double their population.</p>


<h3>The Capital Levy</h3>

<p>If we cannot look forward to any great measure
of relief through these channels, to what then must
we look? By far the most important alternative
remedy which has been put to us is that of a Capital
Levy; it has the enormous virtue that it would
repay on one level of prices the debts incurred at
that level; in short, it would give back one pair
of boots at once for every pair it has borrowed,
instead of waiting and stretching out over future
generations the burden of two pairs. It is so
attractive that one cannot wonder there is a tendency
to slur over its less obvious difficulties.</p>

<p>Advocates of this scheme fall into two camps,
whom I would distinguish broadly as the economist
group and the Labour Party, and if you will
<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a><span class="pagenum" title="67"></span>examine their advocacy carefully, you will see
that they support it by two different sets of contentions,
which are not easily reconciled. The
economists lay stress upon the fact that you not
only pay off at a less onerous cost in real goods, but
that it may, considered arithmetically or actuarially,
be &#8220;good business&#8221; for a payer of high income-tax
to make an outright payment now and have
a lighter income-tax in future. Very much of the
economists&#8217; case rests indeed upon the argument
drawn from the outright cut and the arithmetical
relief. It will be seen that this case depends upon
two assumptions. The first is that the levy in
practice as well as in theory is an outright cut, and
the second, that it is not repeated, or rather that
the income-tax is really effectively reduced. But
if you look at the programme of the other supporters
of the Capital Levy you will not find any convincing
guarantees of its non-repetition. I have not seen
anywhere any scheme by which we can feel politically
insured against its repetition. You will find
plenty of indication that some intend to have both
the levy and a high tax as well, the new money to be
employed for other social purposes. The arguments
based upon arithmetical or actuarial superiority of
the levy for your pocket and for mine may therefore
rather go by the board. But I am not going to
discuss either the question of political guarantees
or the possible future socio-financial policy of the
Labour Party. I will merely ask you to consider
whether the levy is likely to be in practice the
outright cut that is the basis of the chief and most
valid contention for it. Please understand that I
<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a><span class="pagenum" title="68"></span>am not attempting to sum up all the many reasons
for and against this proposal, but only to deal with
the particular virtue claimed for it, bearing upon
the increasing burden of the debt as prices decline.</p>

<p>Any taxation scheme dependent upon general
capital valuation, where the amount to be paid is
large&#8212;say larger than a year&#8217;s revenue&#8212;falls, in
my judgment, into the second or third rate category
of taxation expedients. Whenever we are living in
uncertain times, with no steadiness of outlook,
valuation of many classes of wealth is then a tremendous
lottery, and collection&#8212;which takes time&#8212;may
be no less so.</p>

<p>The fair face of the outright and graduated levy
would be marred in many ways. First, there are
cases affected by valuation. The valuation of a
fixed rate of interest on good security is easy
enough. The valuation of a field or a house in
these days presents more difficulty, but is, of course,
practicable. In practice, however, people do not
own these things outright. They have only an
interest in them. This is where the rub comes.
A very large part of the property in this country
is held in life interests, and on reversions or contingencies.
It is not a question of saying that a
given property is worth &pound;10,000 and that it forms
part of the fortune of Jones, who pays 40 per cent.
duty. The point is that the &pound;10,000 is split between
Jones and Robinson. Jones maybe has a life
interest in it, and Robinson a reversionary interest.
You value Jones&#8217;s wealth by his prospect of life
on a life table, and Robinson has the balance. But
the life table does not indicate the actual likelihood
<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a><span class="pagenum" title="69"></span>of Jones&#8217;s life being fifteen years. It only represents
the actuarial average expectation of all the lives.
This may be useful enough for insurance dependent
on the total experience, but it may be a shocking
injustice to the individual in taxation. Only some
10 per cent. of the Joneses will live for the allotted
time, and for the rest your valuation and your
tax will be dead wrong, either too much or too
little. Jones will be coming to you two years after
he has paid, or rather his executors will come to
you and say: &#8220;We paid a tax based on Jones
living 15 years, and he has died; this ought, therefore,
to be shifted to Robinson.&#8221;</p>


<h3>Difficulties of Valuation</h3>

<p>People often say that a Capital Levy merely
imagines everybody dying at the same time. This
parallel is wrong in degree when you are considering
the ease of paying duty or of changing the market
values by a glut of shares, and it is still more wrong
when you are thinking of ease of valuation. When
a man is dead, he is dead, and in estimating the
death duty you have not to bother about how long
he is going to live! But every time you value a life
interest and take a big slice of it for tax you are
probably doing a double injustice. The charge is
incorrect for two taxpayers. On a flat rate of tax
this difficulty might be made less, but the essence
of any effective levy is a progressive scale. Moreover,
whether you are right or wrong about
Robinson&#8217;s tax, he has nothing in hand with which
to pay it. He has either to raise a mortgage on
<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a><span class="pagenum" title="70"></span>his expectation (on which he pays <em>annual</em> interest)
or pay you by instalments. So far as his burden
is concerned, therefore, there is no outright cut.
You will be getting an annual figure over nearly
the whole class of life interests and reversions.
It is difficult to see how one can escape making
adjustments year after year for some time in the
light of the ascertained facts, until the expiry of,
say, nine or ten years has reduced the disparities
between the estimated valuations and the facts
of life to smaller proportions.</p>

<p>Next come those valuations which depend for
their accuracy upon being the true mid-point of
probabilities. A given mine may last for five
years in the view of some experts, or it may go on
for fifteen in the view of others, and you may take
a mid-point, say ten, and collect your tax, but,
shortly after, this valuation turns out to be badly
wrong, <em>though all your valuations in the aggregate
are correct</em>. While the active procedure of collecting
the levy is in progress for a number of years these
assessments will simply shout at you for adjustment.
There are other types of difficulty in assessment
which involve annual adjustment, but you will
appreciate most the necessity for care in the
collection. Enthusiastic advocates for the levy
meet every hard case put forward where it is
difficult to raise money, such as a private ownership
of an indivisible business, by saying: &#8220;But
that will be made in instalments, or the man can
raise a mortgage.&#8221; But the extent to which this
is done robs the levy of all the virtues attaching
to outrightness, for each instalment becomes, as
<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a><span class="pagenum" title="71"></span>the years roll on, different in its real content upon
a shifting price level, and every payment of interest
on the mortgage&#8212;to say nothing of the ultimate
repayment of that mortgage&#8212;falls to be met as
if reckoned upon the original currency level.
Then those classes of wealth which are not easily
realisable without putting down the market price
also require treatment by instalments, and those who
wish to put forward a logical scheme also add a
special charge upon salary-earners for some years&#8212;a
pseudo-capitalisation of their earning power.</p>

<p>A really fair and practicable levy would certainly
be honeycombed with annual adjustments and
payments for some period of years, and one must
consider how far this would invalidate the economic
case of the &#8220;outright cut,&#8221; and make it no better
than a high income-tax; indeed far worse, for the
high income-tax does at least follow closely upon
the annual facts as they change, or is not stereotyped
by a valuation made in obsolete conditions.
Imagine three shipowners each with vessels valued
at &pound;200,000, and each called upon to pay 20 per
cent., or &pound;40,000. One owning five small ships
might have sold one of them, and thus paid his
bill; the second, with one large ship, might have
agreed to pay &pound;8000 annually (plus interest) for
five years; while the third might have mortgaged
his vessel for &pound;40,000, having no other
capital at disposal. At to-day&#8217;s values each might
have been worth, say, &pound;50,000, but for the tax. The
first would actually have ships worth &pound;40,000, so he
would have borne the correct duty of 20 per cent.
The second would have &pound;50,000, bringing in, say,
<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a><span class="pagenum" title="72"></span>&pound;5000 annually, and would be attempting to pay
&pound;8000 out of it, while the third would be paying
&pound;2000 a year out of his income and still be faced
with an 80 per cent. charge on his fortune! His
assessment is computed at one point of time, and
liquidated at another, when its incidence is totally
different.</p>

<p>If one cannot have a levy complete at the time
of imposition, it clearly ought not to be launched
at a time of rapidly changing prices. But that is,
perhaps, when the economic case for it is strongest.</p>


<h3>A Desperate Remedy</h3>

<p>I do not rule the Capital Levy out as impracticable
by any means, but as a taxation expedient
I cannot be enthusiastic about it. It is a desperate
remedy. But if our present temper for &#8220;annual&#8221; tax
relief at all costs continues, we may <em>need</em> a desperate
remedy. Without a levy what kind of position
can you look forward to? Make some assumptions,
not with any virtue in their details, but just in
order to determine the possible prospect. If in
fifteen to twenty years reparation payments have
wiped out 1000 millions, debt repayments another
1000, and ordinary reductions by sinking funds
another 1000 millions, you will have the debt
down to 5000 millions, and possibly the lower
interest then effective may bring the annual charge
down to some 200 or 225 million pounds. If the
population has reached sixty millions the nominal
annual charge will be reduced from &pound;7 16s. by
one-half, but if prices have dropped further, say
<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a><span class="pagenum" title="73"></span>half-way, to the pre-war level, the comparable
burden will still be &pound;4 10s. per head.</p>

<p>It is no good talking about &#8220;holidays from
taxation&#8221; and imagining you can get rid of this
thing easily; you won&#8217;t. We are still in the war
financially. There is the same need of the true
national spirit and heroism as there was then.
Thus hard facts may ultimately force us to some
such expedient as the levy, but we should not
accept it light-heartedly, or regard it as an obvious
panacea. Perhaps in two or three years we may
tell whether economic conditions are stable enough
to rob it of its worst evils. The question whether
the burden of rapidly relieving debt by this means
in an instalment levy over a decade is actually
lighter than the sinking fund method, depends on
the relation of the drop in prices over the short
period to the drop over the ensuing period, with
a proper allowance for discount&#8212;at the moment
an insoluble problem. I cannot yet with confidence
join those who, on purely economic and non-political
grounds, commend the scheme and treat
it as &#8220;good business for the income-tax payer.&#8221;</p>

<h2><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a><span class="pagenum" title="74"></span><a name="FREE_TRADE" id="FREE_TRADE"></a>FREE TRADE</h2>

<h3>By Rt. Hon. J.M. Robertson</h3>

<h4>P.C.; President of National Liberal Federation since
1920; M.P. (L.), Tyneside Division, Northumberland,
1906-18; Parliamentary Secretary to Board of Trade,
1911-15.</h4>


<p>Mr. Robertson said:&#8212;At an early stage of the
war Mr. H.G. Wells published a newspaper
article to the effect that while we remained Free
Traders we were determined in future to accord
free entry only to the goods of those States which
allowed it to us. The mere state of war, no doubt,
predisposed many to assent to such theses who a
few years before would have remembered that this
was but the nominal position of the average protectionist
of the three preceding generations. War
being in itself the negation of Free Trade, the
inevitable restrictions and the war temper alike
prepared many to find reasons for continuing a
restrictive policy when the war was over. When,
therefore, the Committee of Lord Balfour of
Burleigh published its report, suggesting a variety
of reasons for setting up compromises in a tariffist
direction, there were not wanting professed Free
Traders who agreed that the small tariffs proposed
would not do any harm, while others were even
anxious to think that they might do good.</p>

<p>Yet the policy proposed by Lord Balfour&#8217;s
<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a><span class="pagenum" title="75"></span>Committee has not been adopted by the Coalition
Government in anything like its entirety. Apart
from the Dyestuffs Act, and such devices as the
freeing of home-made sugar from excise, we have
only had the Safeguarding of Industries Bill, a
meticulously conditional measure, providing for the
setting up of particular tariffs in respect of particular
industries which may at a given moment
be adjudged by special committees <em>ad hoc</em> to need
special protection from what is loosely called
&#8220;dumping.&#8221; And even the findings of these
committees so far have testified above all things
to the lack of any accepted set of principles of a
protectionist character. Six thousand five hundred
articles have been catalogued as theoretically liable
to protective treatment, and some dozen have been
actually protected. They have given protection
to certain products and refused it to others;
according it to fabric gloves and glass and aluminium
goods and refusing it to dolls&#8217; eyes and gold
leaf.</p>

<p>Finally, the decision in favour of a tariff on fabric
gloves has evoked such a storm of protest from the
textile manufacturers who export the yarns with
which foreign fabric gloves are made, that even
the Coalitionist press has avowed its nervousness.
When a professed protectionist like Lord Derby,
actually committed to this protectionist Act,
declares that it will never do to protect one industry
at the cost of injuring a much greater one, those
of his party who have any foresight must begin to
be apprehensive even when a House of Commons
majority backs the Government, which, hard
<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a><span class="pagenum" title="76"></span>driven by its tariffists, decided to back its Tariff
Committee against Lancashire. Protectionists are
not much given to the searching study of statistics,
but many of them have mastered the comparatively
simple statistical process of counting votes.</p>


<h3>The &#8220;New Circumstances&#8221; Cry</h3>

<p>In a sense, there are new fiscal &#8220;circumstances.&#8221;
But I can assure my young friends that they are
just the kind of circumstances which were foreseen
by their seniors in pre-war days as sure to arise
when any attempt was made to apply tariffist
principles to British industry. As a German
professor of economics once remarked at a Free
Trade Conference, it is not industries that are
protected by tariffs: it is firms. When a multitude
of firms in various industries subscribed to a large
Tariff Reform fund for election-campaign purposes,
they commanded a large Conservative vote; but
when for platform tariff propaganda, dealing in
imaginative generalities and eclectic statistics,
there are substituted definite proposals to meddle
with specified interests, the real troubles of the
tariffist begin. You might say that they began as
soon as he met the Free Trader in argument; but
that difficulty did not arise with his usual audiences.
It is when he undertakes to protect hides and hits
leather, or to protect leather and hits boot-making,
or to help shipping and hits shipbuilding that he
becomes acutely conscious of difficulties. Now he
is in the midst of them. The threat of setting
up a general tariff which will hit everybody alike
<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a><span class="pagenum" title="77"></span>seems so far to create no alarm, because few
traders now believe in it. Still, it would be very
unwise to infer that the project will not be proceeded
with. It served as a party war-cry in Opposition
for ten years, and nearly every pre-war Conservative
statesman was committed to it&#8212;Earl Balfour and
Lord Lansdowne included. Even misgivings about
Lancashire may fail to deter the tariffist rump.</p>

<p>Some of the people who even yet understand
nothing of Free Trade economics are still found to
argue that, if only the duty on imported gloves is
put high enough, sufficient gloves will be made at
home to absorb all the yarns now exported to
German glove-makers. They are still blind, that
is to say, to the elementary fact that since Germany
manufactures for a much larger glove-market than
the English, the exclusion of the German gloves
means the probable loss to the yarn-makers of a
much larger market than England can possibly
offer, even if we make all our own gloves. In a
word, instead of having to furnish new Free Trade
arguments to meet a new situation, we find ourselves
called upon to propound once more the
fundamental truths of Free Trade, which are still
so imperfectly assimilated by the nation.</p>

<p>So far as I can gather, the circumstances alleged
to constitute a new problem are these; the need
to protect special industries for war purposes;
and the need to make temporary fiscal provision
against industrial fluctuation set up by variations
in the international money exchanges. Obviously,
the first of these pleas has already gone by the
board, as regards any comprehensive fiscal action.
<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a><span class="pagenum" title="78"></span>One of the greatest of all war industries is the
production of food; and during the war some
supposed that after it was over, there could be
secured a general agreement to protect British
agriculture to the point at which it could be relied
on to produce at least a war ration on which the
nation could subsist without imports. That dream
has already been abandoned by practical politicians,
if any of them ever entertained it. The effective
protection of agriculture on that scale has been
dismissed as impossible; and we rely on foreign
imports as before. Whatever may be said as to
the need of subsidising special industries for the
production of certain war material is nothing
further to the fiscal purpose, whether the alleged
need be real or not. The production of war material
is a matter of military policy on all fours with the
maintenance of Government dockyards, and does
not enter into the fiscal problem properly so called.
But to the special case of dyes, considered as a
&#8220;key&#8221; or &#8220;pivotal&#8221; industry, I will return later.</p>

<p>How then stands the argument from the fluctuations
of the exchanges? If that argument be
valid further than to prove that <em>all</em> monetary
fluctuations are apt to embarrass industry, why is
it not founded on for the protection of <em>all</em> industries
affected by German competition? The Prime
Minister in his highly characteristic speech to the
Lancashire deputation, admitted that the fall of
the mark had not had &#8220;the effect which we all
anticipated&#8221;&#8212;that is, which he and his advisers
anticipated&#8212;and this in the very act of pretending
that the <em>further</em> fall of the mark is a reason for
<a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a><span class="pagenum" title="79"></span>adhering to the course of taxing fabric gloves.
All this is the temporising of men who at last
realise that the case they have been putting forward
will bear no further scrutiny. The idea of systematically
regulating an occasional tariff in terms of the
day-to-day fluctuations of the exchanges is wholly
chimerical. A tariff that is on even for one year
and may be off the next is itself as disturbing a
factor in industry as any exchange fluctuations
can be.</p>

<p>Nor is there, in the nature of things, any possibility
of continuous advantage in trade to any
country through the low valuation of its currency.
The Prime Minister confesses that Germany is <em>not</em>
obtaining any export trade as the result of the fall.
Then the whole argument has been and is a false
pretence. The plea that the German manufacturer
is advantaged because his wages bill does not rise
as fast as the mark falls in purchasing power is
even in theory but a statement of one side of a
fluctuating case, seeing that when the mark rises
in value his wages bill will not fall as fast as the
mark rises, and he is then, in the terms of the case,
at a competitive disadvantage.</p>

<p>But the worst absurdity of all in the tariffist
reasoning on this topic is the assumption that in
no other respect than wage-rates is German industry
affected by the fall of the mark. The wiseacres
who point warningly to the exchanges as a reason
for firm action on fabric gloves never ask how a
falling currency relates to the process of purchasing
raw materials from abroad. So plainly is the
falling mark a bar to such purchase that there is
<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a><span class="pagenum" title="80"></span><em>prima facie</em> no cause to doubt the German official
statement made in June, that foreign goods are
actually underbidding German goods in the German
markets, and that the falling exchange makes it
harder and harder for Germany to compete abroad.
We are dealing with a four-square fallacy, the
logical implication of which is that a bankrupt
country is the best advantaged for trade, that
Austria is even better placed for competition than
Germany, and that Russia is to-day the best placed
of all.</p>


<h3>Tariffs and Wages</h3>

<p>The argument from the exchanges, which is now
admitted to be wholly false in practice, really brings
us back to the old tariffist argument that tariffs
are required to protect us against the imports of
countries whose general rate of wages is lower
than ours. On the one hand, they assured us that
a tariff was the one means of securing good wages
for the workers in general. On the other, they
declared that foreign goods entered our country to
the extent they did because foreign employers in
general sweated their employees. That is to say&#8212;seeing
that nearly all our competitors had tariffs&#8212;the
tariffed countries pay the worst wages; and
we were to raise ours by having tariffs also. But
even that pleasing paralogism did not suffice for
the appetite of tariffism in the way of fallacy.
The same propaganda which affirmed the lowness
of the rate of wages paid in tariffist countries
affirmed also the <em>superiority</em> of the rate of wages
<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a><span class="pagenum" title="81"></span>paid in the United States, whence came much of
our imported goods which the tariffists wished to
keep out. In this case, the evidence for the statement
lay in the high wage-rate figures for three
employments in particular&#8212;those of engine-drivers,
compositors, and builders&#8217; labourers: three industries
incapable of protection by tariffs.</p>

<p>Thus even the percentage of truth was turned
to the account of delusion; for the wages in the
protected industries of the States were so far from
being on the scale of the others just mentioned,
that they were reported at times to be absolutely
below those paid in the same industries in Britain.
For the rest, <em>costs of living</em> were shown by all the
official statistics to be lower with us than in any of
the competing tariffed countries; and in particular
much lower than in the United States. There were
thus established the three facts that wages were
higher in the Free Trade country than in the
European tariffed countries; that real wages here
were higher than those of the protected industries
in the United States, and that Protection was
thus so far from being a condition of good wages
as to be ostensibly a certain condition of bad.
All the same, high wages in America and low wages
on the Continent were alike given as reasons why
we should have a protective tariff.</p>

<p>There stands out, then, the fact that the payment
of lower wages by the protected foreign manufacturer
was one of the tariffist arguments of the pre-war
period, when there was no question of unequal
currency exchanges. To-day, the argument from
unequal currency exchanges is that in the country
<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a><span class="pagenum" title="82"></span>where the currency value is sinking in terms of
other currencies the manufacturer is getting his
labour cheaper, seeing that wages are slow to
follow increase in cost of living. Both pleas alike
evade the primary truth that if country A
trades with country B at all, it must receive <em>some</em>
goods in payment for its exports, save in a case in
which, for a temporary purpose, it may elect to
import gold. But that fact is vital and must be
faced if the issue is to be argued at all. Unless,
then, the defender of the occasional tariff system
contends that that system will rectify trade conditions
by keeping out goods which are made at
an artificial advantage, amounting to what is
called &#8220;unfair competition,&#8221; and letting in only
the goods not so produced, he is not facing the
true fiscal problem at all. Either he admits that
exports and freight charges and other credit claims
must be balanced by imports or he denies it. If he
denies it, the discussion ceases: there is no use in
arguing further. If he admits it, and argues that
by his tariff he can more or less determine <em>what</em>
shall be imported, the debate soon narrows itself
to one issue.</p>

<p>The pre-war tariffist argued, when he dealt with
the problem, that tariffs would suffice at will to
keep out manufactured goods and let in only raw
material. To that the answer was simple. An
unbroken conversion of the whole yield of exports
and freight returns and interest on foreign investments
into imported raw material to be wholly
converted into new products, mainly for export,
was something utterly beyond the possibilities.
<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a><span class="pagenum" title="83"></span>It would mean a rate of expansion of exports never
attained and not only not attainable but not
desirable. On such a footing, the producing and
exporting country would never concretely taste of
its <em>profit</em>, which is to be realised, if at all, only in
consumption of imported goods and foods. It
is no less plainly impossible to discriminate by
classes between kinds of manufactured imports
on the plea that inequality in the exchanges gives
the foreign competitor an advantage in terms of
the relatively lower wage-rate paid by him while
his currency value is falling. Any such advantage,
in the terms of the case, must be held to accrue to
all forms of production alike, and cannot possibly
be claimed to accrue in the manufacture of one thing
as compared with another, as fabric gloves in
comparison with gold leaf. In a word, the refusal
of protection to gold leaf is an admission that the
argument from inequality of currency exchanges
counts for nothing in the operation of the Safeguarding
of Industries Bill. In the case of any
other import, then, the argument falls.</p>


<h3>Members One of Another</h3>

<p>But that is not all. The case of Russia alone
has brought home to all capable of realising an
economic truth the fact that the economic collapse
of any large mass of population which had in the
past entered into the totality of international trade
is a condition of proportional impoverishment to
all the others concerned. He who sees this as
to Russia cannot conceivably miss seeing it as to
<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a><span class="pagenum" title="84"></span>Germany; even tariffist hallucinations about a
&#8220;losing trade&#8221; under German tariffs cannot shut
out the fact that our trade with Russia and the
United States was carried on under still higher
hostile tariffs. The unalterable fact remains that
industrial prosperity rises and falls in the measure
of the total mass of goods handled; and men who
realise the responsibility of all Governments for the
material wellbeing of their populations can come
to only one conclusion. Trade must be facilitated
all round for our own sake.</p>

<p>Once more we come in sight of the truth that
the industrial health of every trading country
depends on the industrial health of the rest&#8212;a
Free Trade truth that is perceptibly of more vital
importance now than ever before. It is in the
exchange of commodities, and the extension of
consumption where that is required on a large
scale, that the prosperity of the industrial nations
consists. And to say that, is to say that until the
trade exchanges of the world in general return to
something like the old footing, there cannot be a
return of the old degree of industrial wellbeing.
Not that industrial wellbeing is to be secured by
the sole means of industrial re-expansion: the
question of the need of restriction of rate of increase
of population is now being more and more widely
recognised as vital. But the present argument is
limited to the fiscal issue; and it must suffice
merely to indicate the other as being of the highest
concurrent importance.</p>

<p>Adhering, then, to the fiscal issue, we reach the
position that, just as foreign trade has been a
<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a><span class="pagenum" title="85"></span>main source of British wealth in the past, and particularly
in the Free Trade era, the wealth consumed
in the war is recoverable only on the same lines.
It is not merely that British shipping&#8212;at present
so lamentably paralysed and denuded of earning
power&#8212;cannot be restored to prosperity without
a large resumption of international exchanges:
a large proportion of industrial employment unalterably
depends upon that resumption. And it
is wholly impossible to return to pre-war levels of
employment by any plan of penalising imports.</p>


<h3>The Dyestuffs Act</h3>

<p>How then does the persistent Free Trader relate
to the special case of the &#8220;key industry,&#8221; of which
we heard so much during the war, and hear so little
to-day? I have said that the question of maintaining
any given industry on the score that it is
essential for the production of war material is a
matter of military administration, and not properly
a matter of fiscal policy at all. But the plea, we
know, has been made the ground of a fiscal proceeding
by the present Government, inasmuch as
the special measure known as the Dyestuffs (Import
Regulation) Act of 1920 forbids for ten years the
importation of dyestuffs into this country except
under licence of the Board of Trade. Dyestuffs
include, by definition, all the coal-tar dyes, colours,
and colouring matter, and all organic intermediate
products used in the manufacture of these&#8212;the
last category including a large number of chemicals
such as formaldehyde, formic acid, acetic acid, and
<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a><span class="pagenum" title="86"></span>methyl alcohol. The argument is, in sum, that
all this protective control is necessary to keep on
foot, on a large scale, an industry which in time of
war has been proved essential for the production
of highly important munitions.</p>

<p>What has actually happened under this Act I
confess I am unable to tell. Weeks ago I wrote to
the President of the Board of Trade asking if,
without inconvenience, he could favour me with
a general account of what had been done in the
matter of issuing licences, and my letter was
promised attention, but up to the moment of
delivering this address I have had no further reply.
I can only, then, discuss the proposed policy on its
theoretic merits.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The theoretic issues are fairly
clear. Either the licensing power of the Board of
Trade has been used to exclude competitive imports
or it has not. If it has been so used, it is obvious
that we have no security whatever for the maintenance
of the industry in question in a state of efficiency.
In the terms of the case, it is enabled to persist in
the use of plant and of methods which may be
inferior to those used in the countries whose competition
has been excluded. Then the very object
posited as the justification for the Act, the securing
of a thoroughly efficient key industry necessary to
the production of munitions, is not attained by the
fiscal device under notice. If, on the other hand,
there has been no barring of imports under the
licence system, the abstention from use of it is an
<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a><span class="pagenum" title="87"></span>admission that it was either unnecessary or injurious
or was felt to be useless for its purpose.</p>

<p>And the common-sense verdict on the whole
matter is that if continuous and vigilant research
and experiment in the chemistry of dye-making
is held to be essential to the national safety, the
proper course is for the Government to establish
and maintain a department or arsenal for such
research and experiment, unhampered by commercial
exigencies. Such an institution may or
may not be well managed. But a dividend-earning
company, necessarily concerned first and last with
dividend earning, and at the same time protected
against foreign competition in the sale of its products,
cannot be for the purpose in question well
managed, being expressly enabled and encouraged
to persist in out-of-date practices.</p>

<p>This being so, the whole argument for protection
of key industries goes by the board. It has been
abandoned as to agriculture, surely the most typical
key industry of all; and it has never even been put
forward in regard to shipbuilding, the next in order
of importance. For the building of ships of war
the Government has its own dockyards: let it
have its own chemical works, if that be proved to
be necessary. Protection cannot avail. If the
Dyestuffs Act is put in operation so as to exclude
the competition of foreign chemicals, it not only
keeps our chemists in ignorance of the developments
of the industry abroad: it raises the prices
of dyestuffs against the dye-using industries at
home, and thereby handicaps them dangerously
in their never-ending competition with the foreign
<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a><span class="pagenum" title="88"></span>industries, German and other, which offer the
same goods in foreign markets.</p>

<p>The really fatal competition is never that of
goods produced at low wages-cost. It is that of
superior goods; and if foreign textiles have the
aid of better dyes than are available to our manufacturers
our industry will be wounded incurably.
It appears in fact to be the superior quality of
German fabric gloves, and not their cheapness,
that has hitherto defeated the competition of the
native product. To protect inferior production is
simply the road to ruin for a British industry.
Delicacy in dyes, in the pre-war days, gave certain
French woollen goods an advantage over ours in
our own markets; yet we maintained our vast
superiority in exports by the free use of all the
dyes available. Let protection operate all round,
and our foreign markets will be closed to us by
our own political folly. Textiles which are neither
well-dyed nor cheap will be unsaleable against
better goods.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_1_1">[1]</a></span> The promised statistics were soon afterwards sent to
Mr. Robertson by the Board of Trade. They will be found
in the <em>Liberal Magazine</em> for September, 1922, p. 348.&#8212;<span class="smcap">Ed</span>.</p>


<h3>The Paris Resolutions</h3>

<p>It is of a piece with that prodigy of self-contradiction
that, when the Liberal leaders in the House
of Commons expose the absurdity of professing to
rectify the German exchanges by keeping out
German fabric gloves, a tariffist leader replies by
arguing that the Paris Resolutions of the first
Coalition Government, under Mr. Asquith, conceded
the necessity of protecting home industries
against unfair competition. Men who are normally
<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a><span class="pagenum" title="89"></span>good debaters seem, when they are fighting for a
tariff, to lose all sense of the nature of argument.
As has been repeatedly and unanswerably shown
by my right hon. friend the Chairman, the Paris
Resolutions were expressly framed to guard against
a state of things which has never supervened&#8212;a
state of things then conceived as possible after a
war without a victory, but wholly excluded by
the actual course of the war. And those Resolutions,
all the same, expressly provided that each consenting
State should remain free to act on them upon the
lines of its established fiscal system, Britain being
thus left untrammelled as to its Free Trade policy.</p>

<p>Having regard to the whole history, Free Traders
are entitled to say that the attempt of tariffists
to cite the Paris Resolutions in support of the
pitiful policy of taxing imports of German fabric
gloves, or the rest of the ridiculous &#8220;litter of mice&#8221;
that has thus far been yielded by the Safeguarding
of Industries Act, is the crowning proof at once of
the insincerity and ineptitude of tariffism where
it has a free hand, and of the adamantine strength
of the Free Trade case. If any further illustration
were needed, it is supplied by the other tariffist
procedure in regard to the promise made five
years ago to Canada that she, with the other
Dominions, should have a relative preference in
our markets for her products. In so far as that
plan involved an advantage to our own Dominions
over the Allies who, equally with them, bore with
us the heat and burden of the war, it was as impolitic
as it was unjust, and as unflattering as it was
impolitic, inasmuch as it assumed that the Dominions
<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a><span class="pagenum" title="90"></span>wanted a &#8220;tip&#8221; as a reward for their splendid
comradeship.</p>

<p>As it turns out, the one concession that Canada
really wanted was the removal of the invidious
embargo on Canadian store cattle in our ports.
And whereas a promise to that effect was actually
given by the tariffist Coalition during the war, it
is only after five years that the promise is about
to be reluctantly fulfilled. It was a promise, be it
observed, of <em>free importation</em>, and it is fulfilled
only out of very shame. It may be surmised,
indeed, that the point of the possible lifting of the
Canadian embargo was used during the negotiations
with Ireland to bring the Sister State to terms;
and that its removal may lead to new trouble in
that direction. But that is another story, with
which Free Traders are not concerned. Their
withers are unwrung.</p>


<h3>Science and Experience</h3>

<p>On the total survey, then, the case for Free Trade
is not only unshaken, it is stronger than ever before,
were it only because many of the enemy have
visibly lost faith in their own cause. The Coalition,
in which professed Liberals were prepared to
sacrifice something of Free Trade to colleagues
who were pledged in the past to destroy it, has
quailed before the insuperable practical difficulties
which arise the moment the scheme of destruction
is sought to be framed.</p>

<p>All that has resulted, after four and a half years,
is a puerile tinkering with three or four small
<a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a><span class="pagenum" title="91"></span>industries&#8212;a tinkering that is on the face of it open
to suspicion of political corruption. To intelligent
Free Traders there is nothing in it all that can give
the faintest surprise. They knew their ground.
The doctrine of Free Trade is <em>science</em>, or it is nothing.
It is not a passing cry of faction, or a survival of
prejudice, but the unshakable inference of a hundred
years of economic experience verifying the economic
science on which the great experiment was founded.</p>

<p>On the other hand, let me say, the tactic of
tinkering with Free Trade under a system of special
committees who make decisions that only the
House of Commons should ever be able to make,
is a &#8220;felon blow&#8221; at self-government. It puts
national affairs under the control of cliques, amenable
to the pressures of private interests. Millions of
men and women are thus taxable in respect of their
living-costs at the caprice of handfuls of men appointed
to do for a shifty Government what it is
afraid to do for itself. It is a vain thing to have
secured by statute that the House of Commons
shall be the sole authority in matters of taxation,
if the House of Commons basely delegates its
powers to unrepresentative men. Here, as so often
in the past, the Free Trade issue lies at the heart
of sound democratic politics; and if the nation
does not save its liberties in the next election it
will pay the price in corrupted politics no less than
in ruined trade.</p>

<h2><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a><span class="pagenum" title="92"></span><a name="INDIA" id="INDIA"></a>INDIA</h2>

<h3>By Sir Hamilton Grant</h3>

<h4>K.C.S.I., K.C.I.E.; Chief Commissioner, North-West
Frontier Province, India; Deputy Commissioner of
various Frontier districts; Secretary to Frontier
Administration; Foreign Secretary, 1914-19; negotiated
Peace Treaty with Afghanistan, 1919.</h4>


<p>Sir Hamilton Grant said:&#8212;I have been asked
to address you on the subject of India, that vast,
heterogeneous continent, with its varied races, its
Babel of languages, its contending creeds. There
are many directions in which one might approach
so immense a topic, presenting, as it does, all
manner of problems, historical, ethnological, linguistic,
scientific, political, economic, and strategic.
I do not propose, however, to attempt to give you
any general survey of those questions, or to offer
you in tabloid form a resum&eacute; of the matters that
concern the government of India. I propose to
confine my remarks to two main questions which
appear to be of paramount importance at the
present time, and which, I believe, will be of interest
to those here present to-day, namely, the problems
of the North-West Frontier, and the question of
internal political unrest.</p>

<p>Let me deal first with the North-West Frontier.
As very few schoolboys know, we have here a dual
boundary&#8212;an inner and an outer line. The inner
line is the boundary of the settled districts of the
<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a><span class="pagenum" title="93"></span>North-West Frontier Province, the boundary, in
fact, of British India proper, and is known as the
Administrative border. The outer line is the
boundary between the Indian Empire and Afghanistan,
and is commonly known as the Durand line,
because it was settled by Sir Mortimer Durand
and his mission in 1895 with the old Amir Abdur
Rahman. These two lines give us three tracts to
be dealt with&#8212;first, the tract inside the inner line,
the settled districts of the North-West Frontier
Province, inhabited for the most part by sturdy
and somewhat turbulent Pathans; second, the
tract between the two lines, that welter of
mountains where dwell the hardy brigand hillmen:
the tribes of the Black Mountain, of Swat and
Bajur, the Mohmands, the Afridis, the Orakzais,
the Wazirs, the Mahsuds, and a host of others,
whose names from time to time become familiar
according as the outrageousness of their misconduct
necessitates military operations<a name="typo_1" id="typo_1"></a>; third, the country
beyond the outer line, &#8220;the God-granted kingdom
of Afghanistan and its dependencies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now each of these tracts presents its own peculiar
problems, though all are intimately inter-connected
and react one on the other. In the settled districts
we are confronted with the task of maintaining
law and order among a backward but very virile
people, prone to violence and impregnated with
strange but binding ideas of honour, for the most
part at variance with the dictates of the Indian
Penal Code. For this reason there exists a special
law called the Frontier Crimes Regulation, a most
valuable enactment enabling us to deal with cases
<a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a><span class="pagenum" title="94"></span>through local Councils of Elders, with the task
of providing them with education, medical relief
etc., in accordance with their peculiar needs,
and above all with the task of affording them
protection from the raids and forays of their neighbours
from the tribal hills. In the tribal area we
are faced with the task of controlling the wild
tribesmen. This control varies from practically
direct administration as in the Lower Swat and
Kurram valleys to the most shadowy political
influence, as in the remote highlands of Upper
Swat and the Dir Kohistan, where the foot of white
man has seldom trod. Our general policy, however,
with the tribes is to leave them independent in
their internal affairs, so long as they respect British
territory and certain sacrosanct tracts beyond the
border, such as the Khyber road, the Kurram, and
the Tochi. The problem is difficult, because when
hardy and well-armed hereditary robbers live in
inaccessible mountains which cannot support the
inhabitants, overlooking fat plains, the temptation
to raid is obviously considerable: and when
this inclination to raid is reinforced by fanatical
religion, there must be an ever-present likelihood
of trouble.</p>


<h3>Frontier Raids</h3>

<p>Few people here in England reading of raids on
the North-West Frontier in India realise the full
horror of these outrages. What generally happens
is that in the small hours of the morning, a wretched
village is suddenly assailed by a gang of perhaps
<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a><span class="pagenum" title="95"></span>50, perhaps 200, well-armed raiders, who put out
sentries, picket the approaches, and conduct the
operation on the most skilful lines. The houses of
the wealthiest men are attacked and looted;
probably several villagers are brutally murdered&#8212;and
probably one or two unhappy youths or
women are carried off to be held up to ransom.
Sometimes the raid is on a larger scale, sometimes
it is little more than an armed dacoity. But there
is nearly always a tale of death and damage. Not
infrequently, however, our troops, our militia, our
frontier constabulary, our armed police, or the
village <em>chigha</em> or hue-and-cry party are successful
in repelling and destroying the raiders. Our officers
are untiring in their vigilance, and not infrequently
the district officers and the officers of their civil
forces are out three or four nights a week after
raiding gangs. Statistics in such matters are often
misleading and generally dull, but it may be of
interest to state that from the 1st April, 1920, to
the 31st March, 1921, when the tribal ebullition
consequent on the third Afghan war had begun to
die down, there were in the settled districts of the
North-West Frontier Province 391 raids in which
153 British subjects were killed and 157 wounded,
in which 310 British subjects were kidnapped and
some &pound;20,000 of property looted. These raids are
often led by outlaws from British territory; but
each tribe is responsible for what emanates from
or passes through its limits&#8212;and when the bill
against a tribe has mounted up beyond the possibility
of settlement, there is nothing for it but
punitive military operations. Hence the large
<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a><span class="pagenum" title="96"></span>number of military expeditions that have taken
place on this border within the last half century.</p>

<p>Now this brings us to the question so often asked
by the advocates of what is called the Forward
policy: &#8220;If the tribes give so much trouble, why
not go in and conquer them once and for all and
occupy the country up to the Durand line?&#8221; It
sounds an attractive solution, and it has frequently
been urged on paper by expert soldiers. But the
truth is that to advance our frontier only means
advancing the seat of trouble, and that the
occupation of tribal territory by force is a much
more formidable undertaking than it sounds. We
have at this moment before us a striking proof of
the immense difficulty and expense of attempting
to tame and occupy even a comparatively small
tract of tribal territory in the Waziristan operations.
Those operations have been going on for two and a
half years. At the start there were ample troops,
ample equipment, and no financial stringency.
The operations were conducted, if a layman may
say so, with skill and determination, and our troops
fought gallantly. But what is the upshot? We
managed to advance into the heart of the Mahsud
country on a single line, subjected and still subject
to incessant attacks by the enemy; but we are
very little nearer effective occupation than when
we started; and now financial stringency has
necessitated a material alteration in the whole
programme, and we are reverting more or less to
the methods whereby we have always controlled
the tribes, namely, tribal levies or <em>khassadars</em>
<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a><span class="pagenum" title="97"></span>belonging to the tribe itself, frontier militia or
other armed civil force, backed by troops behind.</p>


<h3>Frontier Policy</h3>

<p>And for my own part I believe this is the best
solution. We must not expect a millennium on the
North-West Frontier. The tribal lion will not lie
down beside the district lamb in our time, and we
must deal with the problem as best we can in
accordance with our means, and to this end my
views are briefly as follows:&#8212;</p>

<p>(1) We should do everything possible to provide
the younger trans-border tribesmen with all honourable
employment for which they are suited:
service in the army, in the frontier civil forces,
and in the Indian police or similar forces overseas,
and we should give labour and contracts as far as
possible to tribesmen for public works in their
vicinity. For the problem is largely economic.
Unless the lion gets other food he is bound to cast
hungry eyes on the lamb.</p>

<p>(2) We should do all that is possible to establish
friendly relations with the tribal elders through
selected and sympathetic political officers, to give
them, by means of subsidies for service, an interest
in controlling the hot-bloods of their tribe, and,
where possible, to give them assistance in education
and enlightenment. We must remember that we
have duties to the tribes as well as rights against
them.</p>

<p>(3) We should extend the <em>khassadar</em> or levy
system; that is, we should pay for tribal corps to
<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a><span class="pagenum" title="98"></span>police their own borders, arming themselves and
providing their own ammunition and equipment.
In this way we give honourable employment and
secure an effective safeguard against raiders without
pouring more arms into tribal territory.</p>

<p>(4) We must have efficient irregular civil forces,
militia, frontier constabulary, and police, well paid
and contented.</p>

<p>(5) We should revert to the old system of a
separate frontier force in the army, specially
trained in the work of guarding the marches.
Those who remember the magnificent old Punjab
frontier force will agree with me in deploring its
abolition in pursuance of a scheme of army
reorganisation.</p>

<p>(6) We should improve communications, telephones,
telegraphs, and lateral M.T. roads.</p>

<p>(7) We should give liberal rewards for the interception
and destruction of raiding gangs, and the
rounding up of villages from which raids emanate.</p>

<p>(8) We should admit that the Amir of Afghanistani
for religious reasons exercises a paramount
influence over our tribes, and we should get him to
use that influence for the maintenance of peace on
our common border. It has been the practise of
our statesmen to adopt the attitude that because
the Amir was by treaty precluded from interfering
with our tribes, therefore he must have nothing to
do with them. This is a short-sighted view. We
found during the Great War the late Amir&#8217;s influence,
particularly over the Mahsuds, of the greatest value,
when he agreed to use it on our behalf.</p>

<p>(9) Finally, there is a suggestion afoot that the
<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a><span class="pagenum" title="99"></span>settled districts of the North-West Frontier Province
should be re-amalgamated with the Punjab.
I have shown, I think, clearly, how inseparable are
the problems of the districts, the tribal area, and of
Afghanistan; and any attempt to place the districts
under a separate control could only mean friction,
inefficiency, and disaster. The proposal is, indeed,
little short of administrative lunacy. There is,
however, an underlying method in the madness
that has formulated it, namely, the self-interest
of a clever minority, which I need not now dissect.
I trust that if this proposal should go further it
will be stoutly resisted.</p>


<h3>Afghanistan</h3>

<p>Let me now turn to Afghanistan. Generally
speaking, the story of our dealings with that
country has been a record of stupid, arrogant
muddle. From the days of the first Afghan war,
when an ill-fated army was despatched on its crazy
mission to place a puppet king, Shah Shuja, on the
throne of Afghanistan, our statesmen have, with
some notable exceptions, mishandled the Afghan
problem. And yet it is simple enough in itself.
For we want very little of Afghanistan, and she
does not really want much of us. All we want
from the Amir is good-neighbourliness; that he
should not allow his country to become the focus
of intrigue or aggression against us by Powers
hostile to us, and that he should co-operate with
us for the maintenance of peace on our common
border. All he wants of us is some assistance in
<a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a><span class="pagenum" title="100"></span>money and munitions for the internal and external
safeguarding of his realm, commercial and other facilities,
and honourable recognition, for the Afghan,
like the Indian, has a craving for self-respect and
the respect of others.</p>

<p>Now, where our statesmen have failed is in
regarding Afghanistan as a petty little State to be
browbeaten and ordered about at our pleasure,
without recognising the very valuable cards that
the Amir holds against us. He sees his hand and
appraises it at its value. He knows, in the first
place, that nothing can be more embarrassing to us
than the necessity for another Afghan war, and
the despatch of a large force to the highlands of
Kabul, to sit there possibly for years as an army
of occupation, in a desolate country, incapable of
affording supplies for the troops, at enormous cost
which could never be recovered, and at the expense
of much health and life, with no clear-cut policy
beyond. He knows, in the second place, that such
a war would be the signal for the rising of practically
every tribe along our frontier. The cry of <em>Jehad</em>
would go forth, as in the third Afghan war, and
we should be confronted sooner or later with an
outburst from the Black Mountain to Baluchistan&#8212;a
formidable proposition in these days. He
knows, in the third place, that with Moslem feeling
strained as it is to-day on the subject of Turkey,
there would be sympathy for him in India, and
among the Moslem troops of the Indian army.
Now these are serious considerations, but I do not
suggest that they are so serious as to make us
tolerate for a moment an offensive or unreasonable
<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a><span class="pagenum" title="101"></span>attitude on the part of the Amir. If the necessity
should be forced on us, which God forbid, we
should face the position with promptitude and
firmness and hit at once; and apart from an
advance into Afghanistan we have a valuable card
in the closing of the passes and the blockade of
that country.</p>

<p>All I suggest is that in negotiating with Afghanistan,
we should remember these things and should
not attempt to browbeat a proud and sensitive
ruler, who, however inferior in the ordinary equipment
for regular war, holds such valuable assets
on his side. And my own experience is that the
Afghans are not unreasonable. Like every one
else, they will &#8220;try it on,&#8221; but if handled courteously,
kindly, with geniality, and, above all, with complete
candour, they will generally see reason. And remember
one thing. In spite of all that has happened,
our mistakes, our bluster, our occasional lapses
from complete disingenuousness, the Afghans still
like us. Moreover, their hereditary mistrust of
Russia still inclines them to lean on us. We have
lately concluded a treaty with Afghanistan&#8212;not
by any means a perfect treaty, but the best
certainly that could be secured in the circumstances,
and we have sent a Minister to Kabul,
Lt.-Colonel Humphrys, who was one of my officers
on the frontier. A better man for the post could
not, I believe, be found in the Empire. Unless
unduly hampered by a hectoring diplomacy from
Whitehall, he will succeed in establishing that
goodwill and mutual confidence which between
Governments is of more value than all the paper
<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a><span class="pagenum" title="102"></span>engagements ever signed. One word more of the
Afghans. There is an idea that they are a treacherous
and perfidious people. This, I believe, is
wicked slander, so far as the rulers are concerned.
In 1857, during the Indian Mutiny, the Amir Dost
Muhammed was true to his bond, when he might
have been a thorn in our side; and during the
Great War the late Amir Halilullah, in the face of
appalling difficulties, maintained the neutrality of
his country, as he promised, and was eventually
murdered, a martyr to his own good faith to us.</p>


<h3>Internal Unrest</h3>

<p>Let me now turn to our second question: internal
political unrest. In clubs and other places where
wise men in arm-chairs lay down the law about
affairs of state, one constantly hears expressions
of surprise and indignation that there should be
any unrest in India at all. &#8220;We have,&#8221; say the
die-hard wiseacres, &#8220;governed India jolly well and
jolly honestly, and the Indians ought to be jolly
grateful instead of kicking up all this fuss. If that
meddlesome Montagu had not put these wicked
democratic ideas into their heads, and stirred up
all this mud, we should have gone on quite comfortable
as before.&#8221; But if we face the facts squarely,
we shall see that the wonder is not that there has
been so much, but that there has been so comparatively
little unrest, and that India should, on
the whole, have waited so patiently for a definite
advance towards self-government.</p>

<p>What are the facts? They are these. Partly
<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a><span class="pagenum" title="103"></span>by commercial enterprise, partly by adroit diplomacy,
partly by accident, largely by the valour of
our arms, we have obtained dominion over the
great continent of India. We have ruled it for
more than a century through the agency of a
handful of Englishmen, alien in creed, colour, and
custom from the people whom they rule&#8212;men
who do not even make their permanent homes in
the land they administer. Now, however efficient,
however honest, however impartial, however disinterested
such a rule may be, it cannot obviously
be really agreeable to the peoples ruled. This is
the fundamental weakness of our position. That
our rule on these lines has lasted so long and has
been so successful is due not to the fact alone that
it has been backed by British bayonets, but rather
to the fact that it has been remarkably efficient,
honest, just, and disinterested&#8212;and, above all,
that we have in the past given and secured goodwill.</p>

<p>Superimposed on this underlying irritant, there
have been of late years a number of other more
direct causes of unrest. Education, which we gave
to India and were bound to give, had inevitably
bred political aspiration, and an <em>intelligensia</em> had
grown up hungry for political rights and powers.
Simultaneously the voracious demands of a centralised
bureaucracy for reports and returns had
left the district officer little leisure for that close
touch with the people which in the past meant
confidence and goodwill. Political restlessness
had already for some years begun to manifest itself
in anarchical conspiracies and crimes of violence,
<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a><span class="pagenum" title="104"></span>when the Great War began. In India, as elsewhere,
the reflex action of the war was a disturbing
element. High prices, stifled trade, high taxation,
nationalist longings and ideas of self-determination
and self-government served to reinforce subterranean
agitation.</p>

<p>But throughout the war India not only remained
calm and restrained, but her actual contribution
to the war, in men and material, was colossal and
was ungrudgingly given. She had a right to expect
in return generous treatment; but what did she
get? She got the Rowlatt Bill. Now, of course,
there was a great deal of wicked, lying nonsense
talked by agitators about the provisions of the
Rowlatt Bill, and the people were grossly misled.
But the plain fact remains that when India had
emerged from the trying ordeal of the war, not
only with honour untarnished, but having placed
us under a great obligation, our first practical
return was to pass a repressive measure, for fear,
forsooth, that if it was not passed then it might be
pigeon-holed and forgotten. India asked for bread
and we gave her a stone&#8212;a stupid, blundering act,
openly deprecated at the time by all moderate
unofficial opinion in India. What was the result?
The Punjab disturbances and the preventive massacre
of the Jallianwala Bagh. I do not propose
to dwell on this deplorable and sadly mishandled
matter, save to say that so far from cowing agitation,
it has left a legacy of hate that it will take years to
wipe out; and that the subsequent action of a
number of ill-informed persons in raising a very
large sum of money for the officer responsible for
<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a><span class="pagenum" title="105"></span>that massacre has further estranged Indians and
emphasised in their eyes the brand of their subjection.</p>


<h3>The Rise of Ghandi</h3>

<p>To India, thus seething with bitterness over the
Punjab disturbances, there was added the Moslem
resentment over the fate of Turkey. I was myself
in London and Paris in a humble capacity at the
Peace Conference, and I know that our leading
statesmen were fully informed of the Moslem
attitude and the dangers of unsympathetic and
dilatory action in this matter. But an arrogant
diplomacy swept all warnings aside and scorned
the Moslem menace as a bogey. What was the
result? Troubles in Egypt, in Mesopotamia,
Kurdistan, Afghanistan, and the Khilifat movement
in India. Hindu agitators were not slow to exploit
Moslem bitterness, and for the first time there was
a genuine, if very ephemeral, <em>entente</em> between the
two great rival creeds.</p>

<p>It was in this electric atmosphere that Ghandi,
emerging from his ascetic retirement, found himself
an unchallenged leader. Short of stature, frail,
with large ears, and a gap in his front teeth, he had
none of the outward appearance of dominance.
His appeal lay in the simplicity of his life and
character, for asceticism is still revered in the
East. But his intellectual equipment was mediocre,
his political ideas nebulous and impracticable to a
degree, his programme archaic and visionary; and
from the start he was doomed to fail. The <em>Hijrat</em>
<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a><span class="pagenum" title="106"></span>movement which he advocated brought ruin to
thousands of Moslem homes; his attack on Government
educational establishments brought disaster
to many youthful careers; non-co-operation fizzled
out. Government servants would not resign their
appointments, lawyers would not cease to practise,
and title-holders, with a few insignificant exceptions,
would not surrender their titles; the &#8220;back
to the spinning-wheel&#8221; call did not attract, and the
continual failure of Ghandi&#8217;s predictions of the
immediate attainment of complete <em>Swaraj</em> or self-government,
which he was careful never to define,
like hope deferred turned the heart sick.</p>

<p>From being a demi-god Ghandi gradually became
a bore, and when he was at last arrested, tragic to
relate, there was hardly a tremor of resentment
through the tired political nerves of India. The
arrest was indeed a triumph of wise timing that
does credit to the sagacity of the Government of
India. Had the arrest been effected when the name
of Ghandi was at its zenith, there would have been
widespread trouble and bloodshed. As it was,
people were only too glad to be rid of a gadfly that
merely goaded them into infructuous bogs.</p>

<p>I apologise for this long excursus on the somewhat
threadbare subject of the causes of unrest in India.
But I want those here present to realise what potent
forces have been at work and to believe that the
Indian generally is not the ungrateful, black-hearted
seditionist he is painted by the reactionary
press. India is going through an inevitable stage
of political transition, and we must not hastily
judge her peoples&#8212;for the most part so gallant,
<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a><span class="pagenum" title="107"></span>so kindly, so law-abiding, so lovable&#8212;by the
passing tantrums of political puberty.</p>


<h3>The Present Situation</h3>

<p>As things stand at present, there is a remarkable
lull. It would be futile to predict whether it will
last. It is due in part, as I have suggested, to
general political weariness, in part to the drastic
action taken against the smaller agitating fry, in
part to the depletion of the coffers of the extremists,
in part to the fact that the extremists are quarrelling
amongst themselves as to their future programme.
Some are for continuing a boycott of the Councils;
others are for capturing all the seats and dominating
the legislature; others are for re-beating the
dead horse of non-co-operation. Meanwhile, with
disunion in the extremist camp, the Councils
conduct their business on moderate lines, and, so
far as one can judge, with marked temperance
and sanity.</p>

<p>The work of the first Councils has indeed been
surprisingly good, and augurs well for the future.
India has not yet, of course, by any means grasped
the full significance of representative government.
The party system is still in embryo, although two
somewhat vague and nebulous parties calling
themselves the &#8220;Nationalists&#8221; and the &#8220;Democrats&#8221;
do exist. But these parties have no clear-cut
programme, and they do not follow the lead of
the Ministers, who are regarded, not as representing
the elected members of the Council, but as
newly-appointed additional members of the official
<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a><span class="pagenum" title="108"></span>bureaucracy. There will doubtless in time be
gradual sorting of politicians into definite groups,
but there are two unbridgeable gulfs in the Indian
social system which must always militate against
the building up of a solid political party system:
first, the gulf between Hindu and Moslem, which
still yawns as wide as ever, and second, the gulf
between the Brahman and the &#8220;untouchables&#8221;
who, by the way, have found their fears that they
would be downtrodden under the new Councils
completely baseless.</p>

<p>There are and must be breakers ahead. Some
we can see, and there are doubtless others still
bigger which we cannot yet glimpse over the welter
of troubled waters. What we can see is this:
first, there is a danger that unless Government and
the Councils together can before the next elections
in 1923-24 take definite steps towards the industrial
development and the self-defence of India, the
extremist party are likely to come in in full force
and to create a deadlock in the administration;
second, unless the Councils continue to accept a
fiscal policy in accordance with the general interests
of Great Britain and the Empire, there will be
trouble. The fiscal position is obscure, but it is
the crux, for the Councils can indirectly stultify
any policy distasteful to them, and this too may
mean a deadlock; third, there is a danger that
the Indianisation of the Services will advance much
more rapidly than was ever contemplated, or than
is desirable in the interests of India for many
years to come, for the simple reason that capable
young Englishmen of the right stamp will not,
<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a><span class="pagenum" title="109"></span>without adequate guarantees for their future, accept
employment in India. Those guarantees can be
given satisfactorily by one authority alone, and
that is by the Indian Legislatures voicing popular
opinion. For a complex administration bristling
with technical questions, administrative, political,
and economic, it is essential that India should have
for many years to come the assistance of highly-educated
Britons with the tradition of administration
in their blood. The Councils will be wise to
recognise this and make conditions which will
secure for them in the future as in the past the best
stamp of adventurous Briton.</p>

<p>Finally, the Montagu-Chelmsford scheme, though
a capable and conscientious endeavour to give
gradual effect to a wise and generous policy, has of
necessity its weak points. The system of diarchy&#8212;of
allotting certain matters to the bureaucratic
authority of the Viceroy and of the Provincial
Governors and other matters to the representatives
of the people&#8212;is obviously a stop-gap, which is
already moribund. The attempt to fix definite
periods at which further advances towards self-government
can be considered is bound to fail:
you cannot give political concessions by a stop-watch;
the advance will either be much more
rapid or much slower than the scheme anticipates.
Again, the present basis of election is absurdly
small, but any attempt to broaden it must tend
towards adult suffrage, which in itself would appear
impracticable with a population of over 200
millions.</p>


<h3><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a><span class="pagenum" title="110"></span>Our Duty To India</h3>

<p>It is a mistake, however, in politics to look too
far ahead. Sufficient unto the day. For the time
being we may be certain of one thing, and that is
that we cannot break the Indian connection and
leave India. Both our interests and our obligations
demand that we should remain at the helm of
Indian affairs for many years to come. That
being so, let us accept our part cheerfully and with
goodwill as in the past. Let us try to give India
of our best, as we have done heretofore. Let
us regive and regain, above all things, goodwill.
Let us not resent the loss of past privilege, the
changes in our individual status, and let us face
the position in a practical and good-humoured
spirit. Let us abandon all talk of holding India
by the sword, as we won it by the sword&#8212;because
both propositions are fundamentally false. Let
us realise that we have held India by integrity,
justice, disinterested efficiency&#8212;and, above all, by
goodwill&#8212;and let us continue to co-operate with
India in India for India on these same lines.</p>

<h2><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a><span class="pagenum" title="111"></span><a name="EGYPT" id="EGYPT"></a>EGYPT</h2>

<h3>By J.A. Spender</h3>

<h4>Editor of the <em>Westminster Gazette</em>, 1896 to 1922; Member
of the Special Mission to Egypt, 1919-1920.</h4>


<p>Mr. Spender said:&#8212;The Egyptian problem resembles
the Indian and all other Eastern problems
in that there is no simple explanation or solution
of it. Among the many disagreeable surprises
which awaited us after the war, none was more
disagreeable than the discovery in March, 1919, that
Egypt was in a state of rebellion. For years
previously we had considered Egypt a model of
imperial administration. We had pulled her out
of bankruptcy and given her prosperity. We had
provided her with great public works which had
enriched both pasha and fellah. We had scrupulously
refrained from exploiting her in our own
interests. No man ever worked so disinterestedly
for a country not his own as Lord Cromer for
Egypt, and if ever a Nationalist movement could
have been killed by kindness, it should have been
the Egyptian. Nor were the Egyptian people
ungrateful. I have talked to Egyptian Nationalists
of all shades, and seldom found any who did not
handsomely acknowledge what Great Britain had
done for Egypt, but they asked for one thing more,
which was that she should restore them their
independence. &#8220;We won it from the Turks,&#8221;
<a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a><span class="pagenum" title="112"></span>they said, &#8220;and we cannot allow you to take it
from us.&#8221;</p>

<p>This demand was no new thing, but it was
brought to a climax by events during and after the
war. When the war broke out, our representative
in Egypt was still only &#8220;Agent and Consul-General,&#8221;
and was theoretically and legally on the same
footing with the representative of all other Powers;
when it ended, he was &#8220;High Commissioner,&#8221;
governing by martial law under a system which
we called a &#8220;protectorate.&#8221; This to the Egyptians
seemed a definite and disastrous change for the
worse. Throughout the forty years of our occupation
we have most carefully preserved the theory
of Egyptian independence. We have occupied
and administered the country, but we have never
annexed it or claimed it to be part of the British
Empire. We intervened in 1882 for the purpose
of restoring order, and five years later we offered
to withdraw, and were only prevented from carrying
out our intention because the Sultan of Turkey declined,
at the instigation of another Power, to sign
the Firman which gave us the right of re-occupying
the country if order should again be disturbed.
In the subsequent years we gave repeated assurances
to Egyptians and to foreign Powers that we had
no intention of altering the status of the country
as defined in its theoretical government by Khedive,
Egyptian Ministers, and Egyptian Council or
Assembly. And though it was true that in virtue
of the army of occupation we were in fact supreme,
by leaving the forms of their government untouched
and refraining from all steps to legalise our position
<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a><span class="pagenum" title="113"></span>we reassured the Egyptians as to our ultimate
objects.</p>

<p>In the eyes of the Egyptians the proclamation
of the Protectorate and the conversion of the
&#8220;Agent and Consul-General&#8221; into a &#8220;High Commissioner&#8221;
armed with the weapons of martial
law seriously prejudiced this situation, and though
they acquiesced for the period of the war, they
were determined to have a settlement with us
immediately it was over, and took us very seriously
at our word when we promised to review the whole
situation when that time came. The truth about
the &#8220;Protectorate&#8221; was that we adopted it as a
way out of the legal entanglement which would
otherwise have converted the Egyptians into enemy
aliens when their suzerain, the Sultan of Turkey,
entered the war against us, and we did it deliberately
as the preferable alternative to annexing the
country. But we have neither explained to the
Egyptians nor made clear to ourselves what exactly
we meant by it, and in the absence of explanations
it was interpreted in Egypt as a first step to the
extinction of Egyptian nationality.</p>


<h3>After-War Mistakes</h3>

<p>Had we acted wisely and expeditiously at the
end of the war we might even then have avoided
the trouble that followed. But when Egyptian
ministers asked leave to come to London in
December, 1918, we answered that the time was
not opportune for these discussions, and when the
Nationalist leaders proposed to send a delegation,
<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a><span class="pagenum" title="114"></span>we said that no good purpose could be served by
their coming to Europe. This heightened the
alarm, and the Nationalists retorted by raising
their claims from &#8220;complete autonomy&#8221; to &#8220;complete
independence,&#8221; and started a violent agitation.
The Government retaliated by deporting Zaghlul
to Malta, whereupon the country broke into
rebellion. Lord Allenby now came upon the scene,
and, while suppressing the rebellion, released
Zaghlul and gave him and his delegation the permission
to go to Europe which had been refused in
January. It was now decided to send out the
Milner Mission, but there was a further delay of
seven months before it started, and during all that
time agitation continued.</p>

<p>When the Mission arrived it quickly discovered
that there was no possible &#8220;Constitution under the
Protectorate&#8221; which would satisfy the Egyptians,
and that the sole alternatives were further suppression
or the discovery of some means of settlement
which dispensed with the Protectorate. The
Mission unanimously came to the conclusion that
though the first was mechanically possible if the
cost and discredit were faced, the second was not
only feasible but far preferable, and that the right
method was a treaty of Alliance between Great
Britain and Egypt, recognising Egypt as a sovereign
State, but affording all necessary guarantees for
imperial interests. Working on those lines the
Mission gradually broke down the boycott proclaimed
against them, convinced the Egyptians
of their goodwill, induced all parties of Egyptian
Nationalists to come to London, and there negotiated
<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a><span class="pagenum" title="115"></span>the basis of the Treaty which was described
in the Report. The main points were that there
must be a British force in the country&#8212;not an
army of occupation, but a force to guard Imperial
communications&#8212;that there must be British liaison
officers for law and order and finance, that the
control of foreign policy must remain in the hands
of Great Britain, and that the Soudan settlement
of 1898 must remain untouched, but that with
these exceptions the Government of Egypt should
be in fact what it had always been in theory: a
Government of Egyptians by Egyptians.</p>

<p>Had the Government accepted this in December,
1920 (instead of in March, 1922), and instructed
Lord Milner to go forward and draft a treaty on
this basis, it is extremely probable that a settlement
would have been reached in a few weeks; but
Ministers, unhappily, were unable to make up
their minds, and there was a further delay of three
months before the Egyptian Prime Minister, Adli
Pasha, was invited to negotiate with the Foreign
Office. By this time the Nationalist parties which
the Mission had succeeded in uniting on a common
platform had fallen apart, and the extremists once
more started a violent agitation and upbraided
the moderates for tamely waiting on the British
Government, which had evidently meant to deceive
them. The situation had, therefore, changed again
for the worse when Adli came to London in April,
1921, and it was made worse still by what followed.
The negotiations dragged over six months, and
finally broke down for reasons that have never
been explained, but the probability is that Egypt
<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a><span class="pagenum" title="116"></span>had now got entangled in Coalition domestic politics,
and that the &#8220;Die-Hards&#8221; claimed to have their
way in Egypt in return for their consent to the
Irish settlement. The door was now banged in the
face of all schools of Egyptian Nationalists, and
Lord Allenby was instructed to send to the Sultan
the unhappy letter in which Egypt was peremptorily
reminded that she was a &#8220;part of the communications
of the British Empire,&#8221; and many other
things said which were specially calculated to
wound Egyptian susceptibilities.</p>

<p>The Egyptian Prime Minister resigned, and for
the next five months Lord Allenby endeavoured to
govern the country by martial law without an
Egyptian Ministry. Then he came to London with
the unanimous support of British officials in Egypt
to tell the Government that the situation was
impossible and a settlement imperative. The
Government gave way and British policy was
again reversed, but three opportunities had now
been thrown away, and at the fourth time of asking
the difficulties were greatly increased. The Nationalists
were now divided and the Moderates in danger
of being violently attacked if they accepted a
moderate solution. It was found necessary to
deport Zaghlul Pasha and to put several of his
chief adherents on trial. Suspicions had been
aroused by the delays and vacillations of the
British Government. A settlement by treaty was
now impossible, and Lord Allenby had to give
unconditionally the recognition of sovereignty
which the Mission intended to be part of the treaty,
putting the Egyptians under an honourable pledge
<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a><span class="pagenum" title="117"></span>to respect British rights and interests. In the
circumstances there was nothing else to do, but it
is greatly to be desired that when the constitution
has been completed and the new Assembly convened,
an effort should be made to revert to the
method of the treaty which particularly suited
the Egyptian character and would be regarded
as a binding obligation by Egyptians.</p>


<h3>The Hope of the Future</h3>

<p>In regard to the future, there is only one thing
to do and that is to work honestly to its logical
conclusion the theory now adopted, that Egypt is
a self-governing independent State. Egyptians
must be encouraged to shoulder the full responsibilities
of a self-governing community. It would
be folly to maintain a dual system which enabled
an Egyptian Government to shunt the difficult
or disagreeable part of its task on to a British High
Commissioner. Whatever the system of Government,
there is no escape for either party from the
most intimate mutual relations. Geography and
circumstances decree them, but there is no necessary
clash between the imperial interests which require
us to guard the highway to the East that runs
through Egyptian territory, and the full exercise
of their national rights by Egyptians. Egyptians
must remember that for many years to come the
world will hold us responsible for law and order and
solvency in Egypt, and we on our part must remember
that Egyptians have the same pride in
their country as other peoples, and that they will
<a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a><span class="pagenum" title="118"></span>never consent to regard it as merely and primarily
&#8220;a communication of the British Empire.&#8221; In any
wise solution of the question any sudden breach
with the past will be avoided, and Egyptians will
of their own free will enlist the aid of British officials
who have proved their devotion to the country
by loyal and skilful service. The hope of the
future lies in substituting a free partnership for
a domination of one race by the other, and with
a genial and good-humoured people, such as the
Egyptians essentially are, there should be no
difficulty in restoring friendship and burying past
animosities. But there must be a real determination
on both sides to make Egyptian independence
a success and no disposition on either to give merely
a reluctant consent to the conditions agreed upon
by them and then to throw the onus of failure on
the others.</p>

<p>I deeply regret the schism between the different
schools of Nationalists in Egypt. As we have seen
in Ireland, Nationalism is threatened from within
as well as from without, and it is a great misfortune
that in settling the Egyptian problem we missed
the moment in 1920 when the different Nationalist
parties were all but united on a common platform.
Extremist leaders have the power of compelling
even their friends to deport them and treat them
as enemies, and I assume that Zaghlul put Lord
Allenby under this compulsion, when he decided
that his deportation was necessary. But Zaghlul
was one of the few Nationalist leaders who were
of peasant origin, and his followers stand for
something that needs to be strongly represented
<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a><span class="pagenum" title="119"></span>in the Government if it is not to take its complexion
merely from the towns and the wealthy interests.
The fellah is a very different man from what he was
in the days of Ismail, and it is improbable that he
will again submit to oppression as his forefathers
did but it is eminently desirable that there should
be in the Government men whom he would accept
as leaders and whom he could trust to speak for
him.</p>

<p>Above all, it is to be hoped that, having conceded
the independence of Egypt, we shall not slip back
into governing the country by martial law with
the aid of one party among the Egyptians. That
would be merely an evasion of the difficulty and a
postponement of troubles. There are a good many
difficulties yet to be overcome, and the progress
of events will need careful watching by Liberals in
and out of the House of Commons, but if at length
we steer a straight course and bring political good
sense to the details of the problem, there is no
reason why we should not satisfy the Egyptians
and put Anglo-Egyptian relations on a good and
enduring basis. In dealing with Egypt as with all
Eastern countries, it should constantly be borne
in mind that manners, character, and personality
are a chief part of good politics. To a very large
extent the estrangement has been caused by a
failure to understand and respect the feelings of
the Egyptian people, and here, as in India, it is
important to understand that the demand of the
Eastern man is not only for self-government, but
also for a new status which will enable him to maintain
his self-respect in his dealings with the West.</p>

MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT</h2>

<h3>By Ramsay Muir</h3>

<h4>Professor of Modern History in the University of
Manchester, 1913 to 1921.</h4>


<p>Mr. Ramsay Muir said:&#8212;One of the most marked,
and one of the most ominous, features of the political
situation to-day is that there is an almost universal
decline of belief in and respect for our system of
government. This undermining of the confidence
that a healthy community ought to feel in its
institutions is a perturbing fact which it is the
plain duty of all good Liberals to consider seriously.
We need not be deterred by the old gibe that
Liberalism has always cared more about political
machinery than about social reorganisation. The
gibe was never true. But, in any case, no projects
of social reorganisation have much chance of
success unless the political machinery by means of
which they have to be carried into effect is working
efficiently. Moreover, since most of the projects
of social reform which are being urged upon our
attention involve an enlargement of the activities
of the State, it is obvious that we shall be running
the risk of a breakdown unless we make sure that
the machinery of the State is capable of meeting
the demands which are made upon it. We must
be satisfied that our engine has sufficient power
<a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a><span class="pagenum" title="121"></span>before we require it to draw a double load. In
truth, one reason why the engine of government
is not working well is that it has been required to
do a great deal more work than it was designed for.
The time has come to consider carefully the character
and capacity of our machinery of government in
view of the increased demands which are certain
to be made upon it in the future.</p>

<p>Our national political system may be divided
into two parts. On the one hand, there is the
working machine, which goes on, year in, year out,
whether Parliament is sitting or not, and which
would still go on quite well for a time if Parliament
never met again. We call it the Government, and
we habitually and rightly hold it responsible for
every aspect of national policy and action, for
legislation and finance as well as for foreign policy
and internal administration. On the other hand,
there is what Burke used to call &#8220;the control on
behalf of the nation,&#8221; mainly exercised through
Parliament, whose chief function is to criticise
and control the action of Government, and to
make the responsibility of Government to the
nation a real and a felt responsibility. The discontents
of to-day apply to both parts of the system,
and I propose to deal with them in turn, first
inquiring what is wrong with the working machine
of government and how it can be amended, and
then turning to consider how far the control on
behalf of the nation is working badly, and how it
can be made more efficient.</p>

<p>In what I have called the &#8220;working machine&#8221;
of government there are two distinct elements.
<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a><span class="pagenum" title="122"></span>First, there is the large, permanent, professional
staff, the Civil Service; secondly, there is the
policy-directing body, the Cabinet. Both of these
are the objects of a great deal of contemporary
criticism. On the one hand, we are told that we
are suffering from &#8220;bureaucracy,&#8221; which means
that the permanent officials have too much independent
and uncontrolled, or imperfectly controlled,
authority. On the other hand, we are told that
we are suffering from Cabinet dictatorship, or,
alternatively, that the Cabinet system is breaking
down and being replaced by the autocracy of the
Prime Minister. There is a good deal of <em>prima
facie</em> justification for all these complaints.</p>


<h3>The Growth of the Civil Service</h3>

<p>First, as to bureaucracy. It is manifest that
there has been an immense increase in the number,
the functions, and the power of public officials.
This is not merely due to the war. It has been
going on for a long time&#8212;ever since, in fact, we
began the deliberate process of national reconstruction
in the years following 1832. In itself
this increase has not been a bad thing; on the
contrary, it has been the only possible means of
carrying into effect the great series of reforms
which marked the nineteenth century. And may
I here underline the fact that we Liberals, in
particular, have no right to criticise the process,
since we have been mainly responsible for it, at
any rate in all its early stages. When our predecessors
set up the first Factory Inspectors in
<a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a><span class="pagenum" title="123"></span>1833, and so rendered possible the creation of a
whole code of factory laws; when they created
the first rudimentary Education Office in 1839, and
so set to work the men who have really moulded
our national system of education; when they set
up a bureaucratic Poor Law Board in 1841, which
shaped our Poor Law Policy, and a Public Health
Board in 1848, which gradually worked out our
system of Public Health&#8212;when they did these
things, they were beginning a process which has
been carried further with every decade. If you
like, they were laying the foundations of bureaucracy;
but they were also creating the only
machinery by which vast, beneficial and desperately
needed measures of social reform could be carried
into effect.</p>

<p>And there is yet another thing for which Liberalism
must assume the responsibility. When
Gladstone instituted the Civil Service Commission
in 1853, and the system of appointment by competitive
examination in 1870, he freed the Civil
Service from the reputation for corruption and
inefficiency which had clung to it; and he ensured
that it should attract, as it has ever since done,
much of the best intellect of the nation. But this
very fact inevitably increased the influence of the
Civil Service, and encouraged the expansion of its
functions. If you put a body of very able men
in charge of a department of public service, it is
certain that they will magnify their office, take a
disproportionate view of its claims, and incessantly
strive to increase its functions and its staff. This
is not only natural, it is healthy&#8212;so long as the
<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a><span class="pagenum" title="124"></span>process is subjected to efficient criticism and control.</p>

<p>But the plain fact is that the control is inadequate.
The vast machine of government has outgrown the
power of the controlling mechanism.</p>

<p>We trust for the control of the immense bureaucratic
machine, almost entirely to the presence, at
the head of each department, of a political minister
directly responsible to Parliament. We hold the
minister responsible for everything that happens
in his office, and we regard this ministerial responsibility
as one of the keystones of our system.
But when we reflect that the minister is distracted
by a multitude of other calls upon his time, and that
he has to deal with officials who are generally his
equals in ability, and always his superiors in special
knowledge; when we realise how impossible it
is that a tithe of the multifarious business of a
great department should come before him, and that
the business which does come before him comes
with the recommendations for action of men who
know ten times more about it than he does, it must
be obvious that the responsibility of the minister
must be quite unreal, in regard to the normal
working of the office. One thing alone he can do,
and it is an important thing, quite big enough to
occupy his attention. He can make sure that the
broad policy of the office, and its big new departures,
are in accord with the ideas of the majority in
Parliament, and are co-ordinated, through the
Cabinet, with the policy of the other departments.
That, indeed, is the true function of a minister;
and if he tries to make his <a name="typo_2" id="typo_2"></a>responsibility real beyond
that, he may easily neglect his main work. Beyond
<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a><span class="pagenum" title="125"></span>this consideration of broad policy, I do not hesitate
to say that the theory of ministerial responsibility
is not a check upon the growth of bureaucracy,
but is rather the cover under which bureaucracy
has grown up. For the position of the minister
enables him, and almost compels him, to use his
influence in Parliament for the purpose of diverting
or minimising parliamentary criticism.</p>


<h3>A Check upon Bureaucracy</h3>

<p>How can this growth of inadequately controlled
official power be checked? Is it not apparent that
this can only be done if a clear distinction is drawn
between the sphere of broad policy, in which the
minister both can be and ought to be responsible,
and the sphere of ordinary administrative work for
which the minister cannot be genuinely responsible?
If that distinction is accepted, it ought not to be
impossible for Parliament without undermining
ministerial or cabinet responsibility, to devise a
means of making its control over the ordinary
working of the departments effective, through a
system of committees or in other ways.</p>

<p>The current complaints of bureaucracy, however,
are not directed mainly against the ineffectiveness
of the machinery of control, but against
the way in which public work is conducted by
government officials&#8212;the formalism and red-tape
by which it is hampered, the absence of elasticity
and enterprise; and the methods of government
departments are often compared, to their disadvantage,
with those of business firms. But the
<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a><span class="pagenum" title="126"></span>comparison disregards a vital fact. The primary
function of a government department is not creative
or productive, but regulative. It has to see that
laws are exactly carried out, and that public funds
are used for the precise purposes for which they
were voted; and for this kind of work a good deal
of red-tape is necessary. Moreover, it is essential
that those who are charged with such functions
should be above all suspicion of being influenced
by fear or favour or the desire to make profit; and
for this purpose fixed salaries and security of tenure
are essential.</p>

<p>In short, the fundamental principles upon which
government departments are organised are right
for the regulative functions which they primarily
exist to perform. But they are altogether wrong
for creative and productive work, which demands
the utmost elasticity, adaptability, and freedom for
experiment. And it is just because the ordinary
machinery of government has been used on a large
scale for this kind of work that the outcry against
bureaucracy has recently been so vehement. It
is not possible to imagine a worse method of conducting
a great productive enterprise than to put
it under the control of an evanescent minister
selected on political grounds, and supported by a
body of men whose work is carried on in accordance
with the traditions of the Civil Service.</p>

<p>If we are to avoid a breakdown of our whole
system, we must abstain from placing productive
enterprises under the control of the ordinary
machinery of government&#8212;Parliament, responsible
political ministers, and civil service staffs. But it
<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a><span class="pagenum" title="127"></span>does not follow that no productive concern ought
ever to be brought under public ownership and
withdrawn from the sphere of private enterprise.
As we shall later note, such concerns can, if it be
necessary, be organised in a way which would
avoid these dangers.</p>


<h3>The Cabinet</h3>

<p>We turn next to the other element in the working
machine of government, the Cabinet, or policy-directing
body, which is the very pivot of our
whole system. Two main functions fall to the
Cabinet. In the first place, it has to ensure an
effective co-ordination between the various departments
of government; in the second place, it is
responsible for the initiation and guidance of
national policy in every sphere, subject to the
watchful but friendly control of Parliament.</p>

<p>Long experience has shown that there are several
conditions which must be fulfilled if a Cabinet is
to perform these functions satisfactorily. In the
first place, its members must, among them, be able
to speak for every department of government;
failing this, the function of co-ordination cannot
be effectively performed. This principle was discarded
in the later stages of the war, when a small
War Cabinet was instituted, from which most of
the ministers were excluded. The result was
confusion and overlapping, and the attempt to
remedy these evils by the creation of a staff of
<em>liaison</em> officers under the control of the Prime
Minister had very imperfect success, and in some
<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a><span class="pagenum" title="128"></span>respects only added to the confusion. In the
second place, the Cabinet must be coherent and
homogeneous, and its members must share the same
ideals of national policy. National business cannot
be efficiently transacted if the members of the
Cabinet are under the necessity of constantly
arguing about, and making compromises upon,
first principles. That is the justification for drawing
the members of a Cabinet from the leaders
of a single party, who think alike and understand
one another&#8217;s minds. Whenever this condition
has been absent, confusion, vacillation and
contradiction have always marked the conduct
of public affairs, and disastrous results have
followed.</p>

<p>In the third place, the procedure of the Cabinet
must be intimate, informal, elastic, and confidential;
every member must be able to feel that he has
played his part in all the main decisions of policy,
whether they directly concern his department or
not, and that he is personally responsible for these
decisions. Constitutional usage has always prescribed
that it is the duty of a Cabinet Minister
to resign if he differs from his colleagues on any
vital matter, whether relating to his department
or not, and this usage is, in truth, the main safeguard
for the preservation of genuine conjoint
responsibility, and the main barrier against irresponsible
action by a Prime Minister or a clique.
When the practice of resignation in the sense of
giving up office is replaced by the other kind of
resignation&#8212;shrugging one&#8217;s shoulders and letting
things slide&#8212;the main <a name="typo_3" id="typo_3"></a>virtue of Cabinet
<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a><span class="pagenum" title="129"></span>government has been lost. In the fourth place, in
order that every minister may fully share in every
important discussion and decision, it is essential
that the Cabinet should be small. Sir Robert Peel,
in whose ministry of 1841-6 the system probably
reached perfection, laid it down that nine was the
maximum number for efficiency, because not
more than about nine men can sit round a table in
full view of one another, all taking a real share in
every discussion. When the membership of a
Cabinet largely exceeds this figure, it is inevitable
that the sense of joint and several responsibility
for every decision should be greatly weakened.</p>


<h3>Modern Changes in the Cabinet</h3>

<p>I do not think any one will deny that the Cabinet
has in a large degree lost these four features which
we have laid down as requisite for full efficiency.
The process has been going on for a long time, but
during the last six years it has been accelerated so
greatly that the Cabinet of to-day is almost unrecognisably
different from what it was fifty years
ago. To begin with, it has grown enormously in
size, owing to the increase in the number of departments
of government. This growth has markedly
diminished the sense of responsibility for national
policy as a whole felt by the individual members,
and the wholesome practice of resignation has
gone out of fashion. It has led to frequent failures
in the co-ordination of the various departments,
which are often seen working at cross purposes.
It has brought about a new formality in the
<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a><span class="pagenum" title="130"></span>proceedings of the Cabinet, in the establishment
of a Cabinet Secretariat.</p>

<p>The lack of an efficient joint Cabinet control has
encouraged a very marked and unhealthy increase
in the personal authority of the Prime Minister
and of the clique of more intimate colleagues
by whom he is surrounded; and this is strengthened
by the working of the new Secretariat. All
these unhealthy features have been intensified by
the combination of the two strongest parties in
Parliament to form a coalition; for this has deprived
the Cabinet of homogeneity and made it the scene
not of the definition of a policy guided by clear
principles, but rather the scene of incessant argument,
bargaining, and compromise on fundamentals.
Finally, the responsibility of the Cabinet to Parliament
has been gravely weakened; it acts as the
master of Parliament, not as its agent, and its
efficiency suffers from the fact that its members
are able to take their responsibility to Parliament
very lightly.</p>

<p>All these defects in the working of the Cabinet
system have been much more marked since the
war than at any earlier time. But the two chief
among them&#8212;lessened coherence due to unwieldiness
of size, and diminished responsibility to Parliament&#8212;were
already becoming apparent during
the generation before the war. On the question of
responsibility to Parliament we shall have something
to say later. But it is worth while to ask
whether there is any means whereby the old
coherence, intimacy and community of responsibility
can be restored. If it cannot be restored, the
<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a><span class="pagenum" title="131"></span>Cabinet system, as we have known it, is doomed.
I do not think that it can be restored unless
the size of the Cabinet can be greatly reduced,
without excluding from its deliberations a responsible
spokesman for each department of government.</p>

<p>But this will only be possible if a considerable
regrouping of the great departments can be
effected. I do not think that such a regrouping
is impracticable. Indeed, it is for many reasons
desirable. If it were carried out, a Cabinet might
consist of the following members, who would
among them be in contact with the whole range of
governmental activity. There would be the Prime
Minister; there would be the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, responsible for national finance; there
would be the Minister for Foreign Affairs; there
would be a Minister for Imperial Affairs, speaking
for a sub-Cabinet which would include Secretaries
for the Dominions, for India, and for the Crown
Colonies and Protectorates; there would be a
Minister of Defence, with a sub-Cabinet including
Ministers of the Navy, the Army, and the Air
Force; there would be a Minister for Justice and
Police, performing most of the functions both of
the Home Office and of the Lord Chancellor, who
would cease to be a political officer and be able
to devote himself to his judicial functions; there
would be a Minister of Agriculture, Industry, and
Commerce, with a sub-Cabinet representing the
Board of Trade, the Board of Agriculture, the
Ministry of Mines, the Ministry of Labour, and
perhaps other departments.</p>

<p><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a><span class="pagenum" title="132"></span>Ministers of Public Health and of Education
would complete the list of active administrative
chiefs; but one or two additional members, not
burdened with the charge of a great department
might be added, such as the Lord President of the
Council, and one of these might very properly be
a standing representative upon the Council of the
League of Nations. The heads of productive
trading departments&#8212;the Post Office and the
Public Works Department&#8212;should, I suggest, be
excluded from the Cabinet, and their departments
should be separately organised in such a way as
not to involve a change of personnel when one party
succeeded another in power. These departments
have no direct concern with the determination of
national policy.</p>

<p>On such a scheme we should have a Cabinet of
nine or ten members, representing among them all
the departments which are concerned with regulative
or purely governmental work. And I suggest that
a rearrangement of this kind would not only restore
efficiency to the Cabinet, but would lead to very
great administrative reforms, better co-ordination
between closely related departments, and in many
respects economy. But valuable as such changes
may be, they would not in themselves be sufficient
to restore complete health to our governmental
system. In the last resort this depends upon the
organisation of an efficient and unresting system
of criticism and control.</p>


<h3><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a><span class="pagenum" title="133"></span>The House of Commons</h3>

<p>In any modern State the control of the action
of Government is largely wielded by organs not
formally recognised by law&#8212;by the general movement
of public opinion; by the influence of what is
vaguely called &#8220;the city&#8221;; by the resolutions of
such powerful bodies as trade union congresses,
federations of employers, religious organisations,
and propagandist bodies of many kinds; and, above
all, by the Press. No review of our system would
be complete without some discussion of these
extremely powerful and in some cases dangerous
influences. We cannot, however, touch upon
them here. We must confine ourselves to the
formal, constitutional machinery of national control
over the actions of Government, that is, to Parliament,
as the spokesman of the nation.</p>

<p>An essential part of any full discussion of this
subject would be a treatment of the Second Chamber
problem. But that would demand a whole hour
to itself; and I propose to pass it over for the
present, and to ask you to consider the perturbing
fact that the House of Commons, which is the very
heart of our system, has largely lost the confidence
and belief which it once commanded.</p>

<p>Why has the House of Commons lost the confidence
of the nation? There are two main reasons,
which we must investigate in turn. In the first
place, in spite of the now completely democratic
character of the electorate, the House is felt to
be very imperfectly representative of the national
<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a><span class="pagenum" title="134"></span>mind. And in the second place, it is believed to
perform very inefficiently its primary function of
criticising and controlling the action of Government.</p>

<p>First of all, why do men vaguely feel that the
House of Commons is unrepresentative? I think
there are three main reasons. The first is to be
found in the method of election. Since 1885 the
House has been elected by equal electoral districts,
each represented by a single member. Now, if we
suppose that every constituency was contested by
two candidates only, about 45 per cent. of the
voters must feel that they had not voted for
anybody who sat at Westminster; while many of
the remaining 55 per cent. must feel that they had
been limited to a choice between two men, neither
of whom truly represented them. But if in many
constituencies there are no contests, and in many
others there are three or more candidates, the
number of electors who feel that they have not
voted for any member of the House may rise to
60 per cent. or even 70 per cent. of the total.</p>

<p>The psychological effect of this state of things
must be profound. And there is another consideration.
The very name of the House of Commons
(Communes, not common people) implies that it
represents organised communities, with a character
and personality and tradition of their own&#8212;boroughs
or counties. So it did until 1885. Now
it largely represents totally unreal units which
exist only for the purpose of the election. The only
possible means of overcoming these defects of the
single member system is some mode of proportional
representation&#8212;perhaps qualified by the retention
<a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a><span class="pagenum" title="135"></span>of single members in those boroughs or counties
which are just large enough to be entitled to one
member.</p>

<p>The main objection taken to proportional representation
is that it would probably involve
small and composite majorities which would not
give sufficient authority to ministries. But our
chief complaint is that the authority of modern
ministries is too great, their power too unchecked.
In the middle of the nineteenth century, when our
system worked most smoothly, parties <em>were</em> composite,
and majorities were small&#8212;as they usually
ought to be, if the real balance of opinion in the
country is to be reflected. The result was that the
control of Parliament over the Cabinet was far
more effective than it is to-day; the Cabinet
could not ride roughshod over the House; and
debates really influenced votes, as they now scarcely
ever do. The immense majorities which have
been the rule since 1885 are not healthy. They are
the chief cause of the growth of Cabinet autocracy.
And they are due primarily to the working of the
single-member constituency.</p>

<p>The second ground of distrust is the belief that
Parliament is unduly dominated by party; that its
members cannot speak and vote freely; that the
Cabinet always gets its way because it is able to
hold over members, <em>in terrorem</em>, the threat of a
general election, which means a fine of &pound;1000 a
head; and that (what creates more suspicion than
anything) the policy of parties is unduly influenced
by the subscribers of large amounts to secret party
funds. I am a profound believer in organised
<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a><span class="pagenum" title="136"></span>parties as essential to the working of our system.
But I also believe that there is real substance in
these complaints, though they are often exaggerated.
What is the remedy? First, smaller majorities,
and a greater independence of the individual
member, which would follow from a change in the
methods of election. And, secondly, publicity of
accounts in regard to party funds. There is no
reason why an honest party should be ashamed of
receiving large gifts for the public ends it serves,
and every reason why it should be proud of receiving
a multitude of small gifts. I very strongly hold
that in politics, as in industry, the best safeguard
against dishonest dealings, and the surest means
of restoring confidence, is to be found in the policy
of &#8220;Cards on the table.&#8221; Is there any reason why
we Liberals should not begin by boldly adopting,
in our own case, this plainly Liberal policy?</p>


<h3>Representation of &#8220;Interests&#8221;</h3>

<p>There is a third reason for dissatisfaction with
the composition of the House of Commons, which
has become more prominent in recent years. It is
that, increasingly, organised interests are making
use of the deficiencies of our electoral system to
secure representation for themselves. If I may take
as instances two men whom, in themselves, everybody
would recognise as desirable members of the
House, Mr. J.H. Thomas plainly is, and is bound
to think of himself as, a representative of the
railwaymen rather than of the great community of
Derby, while Sir Allan Smith as plainly represents
<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a><span class="pagenum" title="137"></span>engineering employers rather than Croydon. There
used to be a powerful trade which chose as its motto
&#8220;Our trade is our politics.&#8221; Most of us have
regarded that as an unsocial doctrine, yet the
growing representation of interests suggests that
it is being widely adopted.</p>

<p>Indeed, there are some who contend that we
ought frankly to accept this development and
universalise it, basing our political organisation
upon what they describe (in a blessed, Mesopotamic
phrase) as &#8220;functional representation.&#8221; The doctrine
seems to have, for some minds, a strange
plausibility. But is it not plain that it could not be
justly carried out? Who could define or enumerate
the &#8220;functions&#8221; that are to be represented?
If you limit them to economic functions (as, in
practice, the advocates of this doctrine do), will
you provide separate representation, for example,
for the average-adjusters&#8212;a mere handful of
men, who nevertheless perform a highly important
function? But you cannot thus limit functions
to the economic sphere without distorting your
representation of the national mind and will.
If you represent miners merely as miners, you
misrepresent them, for they are also Baptists or
Anglicans, dog-fanciers, or lovers of Shelley, prize-fighters,
or choral singers. The notion that you
can represent the mind of the nation on a basis of
functions is the merest moonshine. The most you
can hope for is to get a body of 700 men and women
who will form a sort of microcosm of the more intelligent
mind of the nation, and trust to it to control
your Government. Such a body will consist of
<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a><span class="pagenum" title="138"></span>men who follow various trades. But the conditions
under which they are chosen ought to be such as
to impress upon them the duty of thinking of the
national interest as a whole in the first instance,
and of their trade interests only as they are consistent
with that. The fundamental danger of
functional representation is that it reverses this
principle, and impresses upon the representative
the view that his trade is his politics.</p>

<p>But it is useless to deplore or condemn a tendency
unless you see how it can be checked. Why has
this representation of economic interests become
so strong? Because Parliament is the arena in
which important industrial problems are discussed
and settled. It is not a very good body for that
purpose. If we had a National Industrial Council
charged, not with the final decision, but with the
most serious and systematic discussion of such
problems, they would be more wisely dealt with.
And, what is quite as important, such a body
would offer precisely the kind of sphere within
which the representation of interests as such would
be altogether wholesome and useful; and, once it
became the main arena of discussion, it would
satisfy the demand for interest-representation, which
is undermining the character of Parliament. In
other words, the true alternative to functional
representation in Parliament is functional devolution
under the supreme authority of Parliament.</p>

<p>But still more important than the dissatisfaction
aroused by the composition of the House is the
dissatisfaction which is due to the belief that its
functions are very inefficiently performed. It is
<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a><span class="pagenum" title="139"></span>widely believed that, instead of controlling Government,
Parliament is in fact controlled by it. The
truth is that the functions imposed upon Parliament
by increased legislative activity and the growth of
the sphere of Government are so vast and multifarious
that no part of them <em>can</em> be adequately
performed in the course of sessions of reasonable
length; and if the sessions are not of reasonable
length&#8212;already they are too long&#8212;we shall be
deprived of the services of many types of men
without whom the House would cease to be
genuinely representative of the mind of the
nation.</p>

<p>Consider how the three main functions of Parliament
are performed&#8212;legislation, finance, and the
control of administration. The discussion of legislation
by the whole House has been made to seem
futile by the crack of the party whip, by obstruction,
and by the weapons designed to deal with obstruction&#8212;the
closure, the guillotine, the kangaroo. A real
amendment has been brought about in this sphere
by the establishment of a system of committees
to which legislative proposals of various kinds are
referred, and this is one of the most hopeful features
of recent development. But there is still one
important sphere of legislation in which drastic
reform is necessary: the costly and cumbrous
methods of dealing with private bills promoted by
municipalities or by railways and other public
companies. It is surely necessary that the bulk
of this work should be devolved upon subordinate
bodies.</p>

<p>When we pass to finance, the inefficiency of
<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a><span class="pagenum" title="140"></span>parliamentary control becomes painfully clear.
It is true that a good deal of parliamentary time
is devoted to the discussion of the estimates. But
how much of this time is given to motions to reduce
the salary of the Foreign Secretary by &pound;100 in order
to call attention to what is happening in China?
Parliament never, in fact, attempts any searching
analysis of the expenditure in this department or
that. It cannot do so, because the national accounts
are presented in a form which makes such discussion
very difficult. The establishment of an
Estimates Committee is an advance. But even an
Estimates Committee cannot do such work without
the aid of a whole series of special bodies intimately
acquainted with the working of various departments.
In short, the House of Commons has largely lost
control over national expenditure. As for the
control of administration, we have already seen
how inadequate that is, and why it is inadequate.</p>

<p>These deficiencies must be corrected if Parliament
is to regain its prestige, and if our system of government
is to attain real efficiency. For this purpose
two things are necessary: in the first place, substantial
changes in the procedure of Parliament;
in the second place, the delegation to subordinate
bodies of such powers as can be appropriately
exercised by them without impairing the supreme
authority of Parliament as the mouthpiece of the
nation. I cannot here attempt to discuss these
highly important matters in any detail. In regard
to procedure, I can only suggest that the most
valuable reform would be the institution of a
<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a><span class="pagenum" title="141"></span>series of committees each concerned with a different
department of Government. The function of
these committees would be to investigate and
criticise the organisation and normal working of
the departments, not to deal with questions of
broad policy; for these ought to be dealt with in
relation to national policy as a whole, and they
must, therefore, be the concern of the minister and
of the Cabinet, subject to the overriding authority
of Parliament as a whole. In order to secure that
this distinction is maintained, and in order to
avoid the defects of the French committee system
under which independent <em>rapporteurs</em> disregard
and override the authority of the ministers, and
thus gravely undermine their responsibility, it
would be necessary not only that each committee
should include a majority of supporters of Government,
but that the chair should be occupied by the
minister or his deputy.</p>


<h3>Devolution</h3>

<p>Nor can I stop to dwell upon the very important
subject of the delegation or devolution of powers
by Parliament to subordinate bodies. I will only
say that devolution may be, and I think ought to
be, of two kinds, which we may define as regional
and functional. To regional bodies for large areas
(which might either be directly elected or constituted
by indirect election from the local government
authorities within each area) might be
allotted much of the legislative power of Parliament
in regard to private Bills, together with
<a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a><span class="pagenum" title="142"></span>general control over those public functions, such
as Education and Public Health, which are now
mainly in the hands of local authorities. Of
functional devolution the most important expression
would be the establishment of a National
Industrial Council and of a series of councils or
boards for various industries endowed with quasi-legislative
authority; by which I mean that they
should be empowered by statute to draft proposals
for legislation of a defined kind, which would
ultimately receive their validity from Parliament,
perhaps without necessarily passing through the
whole of the elaborate process by which ordinary
legislation is enacted. I believe there are many
who share my conviction that a development in
this direction represents the healthiest method of
introducing a real element of industrial self-government.
But for the moment we are concerned
with it as a means of relieving Parliament from some
very difficult functions which Parliament does not
perform conspicuously well, without qualifying
its supreme and final authority.</p>

<p>One final point. If it is true, as I have argued,
that the decay of the prestige and efficiency of
Parliament is due to the fact that it is already
overloaded with functions and responsibilities, it
must be obvious that to add to this burden the
responsibility for controlling the conduct of great
industries, such as the railways and the mines,
would be to ensure the breakdown of our system
of government, already on the verge of dislocation.
In so far as it may be necessary to undertake on
behalf of the community the ownership and conduct
<a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a><span class="pagenum" title="143"></span>of any great industrial or commercial concern, I
submit that it is essential that it should not be
brought under the direct control of a ministerial
department responsible to Parliament. Yet the
ultimate responsibility for the right conduct of any
such undertaking (<em>e.g.</em> the telephones, electric
supply, or forests) must, when it is assumed by the
State, rest upon Parliament. How is this ultimate
responsibility to be met? Surely in the way in
which it is already met in the case of the Ecclesiastical
Commissioners or the Port of London
Authority&#8212;by setting up, under an Act of Parliament,
an appropriate body in each case, and by
leaving to it a large degree of freedom of action,
subject to the terms of the Act and to the inalienable
power of Parliament to alter the Act. In such
a case the Act could define how the authority should
be constituted, on what principles its functions
should be performed, and how its profits, if it made
profits, should be distributed. And I suggest that
there is no reason why the Post Office itself should
not be dealt with in this way.</p>

<p>It is only a fleeting and superficial survey which
I have been able to give of the vast and complex
themes on which I have touched; and there is no
single one of them with which I have been able to
deal fully. My purpose has been to show that in
the political sphere as well as in the social and
economic spheres vast tasks lie before Liberalism,
and, indeed, that our social and economic tasks
are not likely to be efficiently performed unless we
give very serious thought to the political problem.
Among the heavy responsibilities which lie upon our
<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a><span class="pagenum" title="144"></span>country in the troubled time upon which we are
entering, there is none more heavy than the responsibility
which rests upon her as the pioneer of
parliamentary government&#8212;the responsibility of
finding the means whereby this system may be
made a respected and a trustworthy instrument
for the labours of reconstruction that lie before
us.</p>

<h3>By W.T. Layton</h3>

<h4>M.A., C.H., C.B.E.; Editor of the <em>Economist</em>, 1922;
formerly Member of Munitions Council, and Director
of Economic and Financial Section of the League of
Nations; Director of Welwyn Garden City; Fellow
of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, 1910.</h4>


<p>Mr. Layton said:&#8212;The existing system of private
enterprise has been seriously attacked on many
grounds. For my present purpose I shall deal
with four: (1) The critic points to the extreme
differences of wealth and poverty which have
emerged from this system of private enterprise;
(2) it has produced and is producing to-day recurrent
periods of depression which result in insecurity
and unemployment for the worker; (3) the critics
say the system is producing great aggregations of
capital and monopolies, and that by throwing social
power into the hands of those controlling the
capital of the country, it leads to exploitation of
the many by industrial and financial magnates;
(4) it produces a chronic state of internal war which
saps industrial activity and the economic life of
the community.</p>

<p>I shall not attempt to minimise the force of these
objections; but in order to get our ideas into
correct perspective it should be observed that the
first two of these features are not new phenomena
arising out of our industrial system. You find
<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a><span class="pagenum" title="146"></span>extreme inequalities of distribution in practically
all forms of society&#8212;in the slave state, the feudal
state, in India and in China to-day. Nor is this
the first period of history in which there has been
insecurity. If you look at any primitive community,
and note the effect of harvest fluctuations and the
inevitable famine following upon them, you will
recognise that the variations of fortune which
affect such communities are more disastrous in
their effect than the trade variations of the modern
world.</p>

<p>But after all qualifications have been made
these four indictments are sufficiently serious and
must be met, for it is these and similar considerations
which have driven many to desire the
complete abolition of the system. Some wish to
abolish private property, and desire a Communist
solution. Others practically attack the system
of private enterprise, and wish to substitute either
the community in some form or another (<em>e.g.</em> state
socialism), or some corporate form of industry
(<em>e.g.</em> guild socialism).</p>


<h3>The Liberal Bias</h3>

<p>Liberals, on the other hand, reject these solutions,
and desire not to end the present system but to
mend it. The grounds for this conclusion need to
be clearly expressed, for after all it is the fundamental
point of doctrine which distinguishes them
from the Labour party. In the first place, there is
the fact that Liberals attach a special importance
to the liberty of the individual. The general
<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a><span class="pagenum" title="147"></span>relation of the individual to the State is rather
outside my subject, but we start from the fact
that the bias of Liberals is towards liberty in every
sphere, on the ground that spiritual and intellectual
progress is greatest where individuality is least
restricted by authority or convention. Variety,
originality in thought and action, are the vital
virtues for the Liberal. It is still true that &#8220;in
this age the mere example of Nonconformity, the
mere refusal to bow the knee to custom, is itself a
service.&#8221; The Liberal who no longer feels at the
bottom of his heart a sympathy with the rebel
who chafes against the institutions of society,
whether religious, political, social or economic, is
well on the road to the other camp. But the dynamic
force of Liberty, that great motive power of progress,
though a good servant, may be a bad master; and
the perennial problem of society is to harmonise
its aims with those of the common good.</p>

<p>When we come to the more specific problem of
industry, which is our immediate concern, a glance
at history shows that the era of most rapid economic
progress the world has ever seen has been the era
of the greatest freedom of the individual from
statutory control in economic affairs. The features
of the last hundred years have been the rapidity
of development in industrial technique, and constant
change in the form of industrial organisation
and in the direction of the world&#8217;s trade.
Could any one suppose that in these respects
industry, under the complete control of the State
or of corporations representing large groups of
wage earners and persons engaged in trade, could
<a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a><span class="pagenum" title="148"></span>have produced a sufficiently elastic system to have
permitted that progress to be made? In reply
to this it may be said that though this was true
during the industrial revolution, it does not apply
to-day; that our industries have become organised;
that methods of production, population, and
economic conditions generally are stabilised, and
that we can now settle down to a new and standard
form of industrial organisation. But this agreement
is based on false premises. The industrial
revolution is far from complete. We are to-day
in the full flood of it. Look at the changes in the
last four decades&#8212;the evolution of electricity, the
development of motor transport, or the discoveries
in the chemical and metallurgical industries. Consider
what lies ahead; the conquest of the air, the
possible evolution of new sources of power, and a
hundred other phases which are opening up in
man&#8217;s conquest of nature, and you will agree that
we are still at the threshold of industrial revolution.</p>

<p>I may mention here a consideration which applies
practically to Great Britain. We are a great
exporting country, living by international trade,
the world&#8217;s greatest retail shopkeeper whose business
is constantly changing in character and
direction. The great structure of international
commerce on which our national life depends is
essentially a sphere in which elasticity is of the
utmost importance, and in which standardised or
stereotyped methods of control of production or
exchange would be highly disastrous. Liberal
policy, therefore, aims at keeping the field of
private enterprise in business as wide as possible.
<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a><span class="pagenum" title="149"></span>But in the general discussion of political or
personal liberty in economic affairs, we have to
consider how far and in what way the freedom of
private enterprise needs to be limited or curtailed
for the common good. We must solve that problem.
For Liberals there is no inherent sanctity in the
conceptions of private property, or of private
enterprise. They will survive, and we can support
them only so long as they appear to work better
in the public interest than any possible alternatives.</p>


<h3>Retrospect and Prospect</h3>

<p>My object, then, is to show how a system which
embodies a large amount of private enterprise can
be made tolerable and acceptable to modern ideas
of equity. For this purpose we need to consider
(1) what have we done in that direction in the past?
(2) what is the setting of the economic problem to-day,
and (3) what is to be our policy for the future?</p>

<p>Dealing first with wealth and wages, the whole
field of social legislation has a bearing upon them,
including particularly education, elementary and
technical, the Factory Acts, and a great mass of
legislation which has affected the earning powers
of the worker and the conditions under which he
labours. Just before the war we had come to the
point of fixing a minimum wage in the mines,
but an even more important factor was that we
had introduced the Trade Board system, which
had begun to impose a minimum wage in certain
trades where wages were particularly low. But
the most important direct attack upon the unequal
<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a><span class="pagenum" title="150"></span>distribution of wealth was by taxation in accordance
with the Liberal policy of a graduated and
differential income-tax, and still more important
by taxes upon inheritance; for it has long been
recognised that though it may be desirable to allow
men to accumulate great wealth during their lifetime,
it by no means follows that they should be
entitled to control the distribution of wealth in the
next generation and launch their children on the
world with a great advantage over their fellows
of which they may be quite unworthy. On the
question of insecurity it cannot be said that any
serious attack has been made on the problem of
how to diminish fluctuations of trade, but again
the Liberal solution for dealing with that difficulty
was to remedy not the cause but its effects by
insurance.</p>

<p>On the question of monopolies and exploitation,
though we hear a great deal of the growth of
capitalistic organisation, in fact we find that, of
the three greatest industrial countries in the world,
Great Britain is the least trust-ridden, mainly
because of its free trade system. In the case of
enterprises not subject to foreign competition, we
had begun to develop a fairly satisfactory system
of control of public utility services which were of
a monopolistic character.</p>

<p>Finally, there had been growing up a complete
system of collective bargaining and conciliation,
and though we always heard of it whenever there
was dispute and strife, the ordinary public did not
know that this machinery was working and developing
in many great and important industries a
<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a><span class="pagenum" title="151"></span>feeling of co-operation or at all events of conciliation
between the two sides. I only mention
these points very briefly in passing in order to show
that with the evolution of modern industry we
were already feeling our way, haltingly and far too
slowly, it is true, towards a solution of its most
serious defects.</p>

<p>Turning to the present situation, we have to face
the fact that Great Britain is to-day faced with
one of the most serious positions in its economic
history. We must make allowances for the readily
understood pessimism of a miners&#8217; leader, but it
should arrest attention that Mr. Frank Hodges
has recently described the present situation as
the coming of the great famine in England. For
nearly two decades before the war there was
occurring a slight fall in the real wages of British
workpeople. Food was becoming dearer, as the
world&#8217;s food supply was not increasing as fast as
the world&#8217;s industrial population, and the industrial
workers of the world had, therefore, to offer more
of their product to secure the food they needed.
Hence the cost of living was rising faster than
wages, except in trades where great technical
advances were being made. There is some reason
to fear that the war may have accentuated this
tendency.</p>

<p>For some years the distant countries of the world
have had to do without European manufactured
goods. You are all aware of the tendency, for
example, of India, Australia, and Canada to develop
their own steel resources and to create manufacturing
industries of all kinds. Moreover, we have lost
<a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a><span class="pagenum" title="152"></span>part of our hold on the food-producing countries
of the world by the sale of our capital investments
in those countries to pay for the war. These and
other considerations all suggest that we may find
it increasingly difficult to maintain our position
as one of the main suppliers of the manufactured
goods of the world. In such circumstances we
shall be hard put to it to maintain, far less raise,
the pre-war standard of living.</p>

<p>How then are we to cope with this problem of
retaining our economic position? We can only
hope to do it if the present financial difficulties and
obstructions working through the exchanges, by
which international commerce is restricted and
constrained, are removed. We can only do it if
and so long as the conception of international
division of labour is maintained. And we can only
do it if&#8212;granted that we can induce the world to
accept this principle of international division of
labour&#8212;we can prove ourselves, by our economic
and productive efficiency, to be the best and
cheapest producer of those classes of goods in which
our skilled labour and fixed capital is invested.</p>

<p>Assuming the financial difficulty is overcome,
and that the old r&eacute;gime of international specialisation
revives, can we still show to the world that it
is more profitable for them to buy goods and
services from us than from other people? Can
we compete with other industrial countries of the
world? The actual output of our labour in most
cases is far less than its potential capacity, partly
because of technical conservatism, and partly for
reasons connected with the labour situation. How
<a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a><span class="pagenum" title="153"></span>are we to mobilise these reserve resources. I have
only space to deal with the second of these problems.
In Germany labour is well disciplined, and has the
military virtues of persistence and obedience to
orders in the factory. But we cannot hope to call
forth the utmost product of our labouring population
by drill-sergeant methods.</p>

<p>In America this problem is a different one,
because the American employer is often able to
take full advantage of his economic position. For
he has a labouring population of mixed nationality,
which does not readily combine, and he can play
off one section against the other. British employers
cannot, if they would, deal with British labour
on the principle of Divide and Rule. There is
only one method by which we can hope to call
forth this great reserve capacity of British labour,
and that is by securing its confidence. If Free
Trade is one of the legs on which British prosperity
rests, the other is goodwill and active co-operation
between the workman and his employer. How is
that goodwill to be gained?</p>

<p>The solution of that problem is only partly in
the hands of the politician; that is one of the
reasons why it is extremely difficult to suggest an
industrial policy which is going to hold out the
hope of reaching Utopia in a short time. But it
is obviously essential somehow or another to develop,
particularly among employers, the sense of trusteeship&#8212;the
sense that a man who controls a large
amount of capital is in fact not merely an individual
pursuing his own fortune, but is taking the very
great responsibility of controlling a fragment of the
<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a><span class="pagenum" title="154"></span>nation&#8217;s industrial resources. And we have also
to develop a conception of partnership and joint
enterprise between employer and employed.</p>


<h3>State Ownership: For and Against</h3>

<p>What policy in the political field can be adopted
to further these objects? Reverting once more to
the fourfold division which I made at the outset,
but taking the points in a different order, there is
first the question whether there should be a great
extension of State ownership, management, or
control of monopolies and big business. In spite
of the experience of the war, I suggest tentatively
that no case has been made out for any wide or
general extension of the field of State management
in industry. This, however, is not a matter of
principle, but of expediency, where each case must
be considered on its merits. Liberals should, indeed,
keep an open mind in this connection and not be
afraid to face an enlargement of the field of State
management from time to time. There are, however,
two special cases to be considered: the mines
and the railways. As to the mines, the solution
Mr. McNair puts forward is on characteristically
Liberal lines, because it will endeavour to harmonise
the safeguarding of the interests of the State with
the maximum freedom to private enterprise and the
maximum scope for variety in methods of management.
As to transport, we have recently passed
an Act altering the form of control of British
railways.</p>

<p>Personally I think the question whether railways
<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a><span class="pagenum" title="155"></span>should or should not be nationalised is very much
on the balance. It is obviously one of the questions
where objections to State management are less
serious than in most other cases. On the other
hand, we may be able to find methods of control
which may be even better than State management.
I do not think the Act of last year fulfils the conditions
which Liberals would have imposed on the
railways, for the principle of guaranteeing to a
monopoly a fixed income practically without any
means of securing its efficiency, is the wrong way
to control a public utility service. If we are going
to leave public utilities in the hands of private
enterprise, the principle must be applied that
profit should vary in proportion to the services
rendered to the community. In this connection
the old gas company principle developed before
the war is an admirable one. Under it the gas
companies were allowed to increase their dividends
in proportion as they lowered their prices to the
community. That is a key principle, and some
adaptation of it is required wherever such services
are left in private hands. My own view is that
an amended form of railway control should first
be tried, and if that fails we should be prepared
for some form of nationalisation.</p>


<h3>Trusts and Monopolies</h3>

<p>But if we refuse at present to enlarge the sphere
of State management, we are still faced with the
problem of dealing with trusts and monopolies.
In this matter, as in so many other instances, the
<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a><span class="pagenum" title="156"></span>right policy has already been worked out. Under
the stimulating conditions which obtained during
the war, when old-established methods of thought
had been rudely shaken, progressive ideas had
unusually free play; and you will find in the
general economic policy adumbrated during and
immediately after the war much that Liberals are
looking for. On this question of monopolies, we
should put into force the recommendation of the
Committee on Trusts of 1919, with one qualification.
The policy I suggest is the policy of the majority,
namely, that we should give very much enlarged
powers of inquiry to the Board of Trade, and that
a Tribunal should be set up by which investigations
could be made. But I would go further, and, taking
one item from the Minority Report, I would add
that either to this Tribunal or to the Board of
Trade department concerned there should be
given in reserve the power in special cases to regulate
prices. I do not think it would be necessary often
to use that power, indeed the mere inquiry and
publicity of results would be sufficient to modify
the action of monopolies. But such a power in
reserve, even though price-fixing in ordinary circumstances
is usually mischievous and to be
deprecated, would have a very salutary effect.</p>

<p>In the case of public utilities of a standard kind,
into which the element of buying and selling profits
does not greatly enter, we should endeavour to
start the experiment of putting representatives
of the workpeople on the boards of directors, but
in carefully selected cases, and not as a general
rule. My own view is that if we are ready with
<a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a><span class="pagenum" title="157"></span>the machinery of investigation, and are prepared
to deal in these ways with public utilities at home
where foreign competition is absent, we have little
to fear from trusts.</p>


<h3>Distribution</h3>

<p>As regards distribution and wages, in the first
place we should adhere to our traditional policy,
developing the system of differential and graduated
taxation, and we should be prepared, if unequal
distribution of wealth continues, to limit further
the right of inheritance. This is not a new Liberal
doctrine: it is many decades old. On the question
of wages we have to recognise that unless we can
secure an increase in terms of food and other
commodities of the national production the State
cannot radically modify the general standard of
living in the country; or by administrative action
raise the level of wages which economic conditions
are imposing on us. But the State can and should
enforce a minimum in certain industries, provided
that minimum is reasonably in harmony with the
competitive level of wages. Such action can
prevent workers whose economic position is not a
strong one&#8212;and this applies particularly to many
women&#8217;s employment&#8212;from being compelled to
accept wages substantially less than the current
standard. I therefore welcome the gradual extension
of the Trade Board system, provided it follows
the general principle recommended in the Cave
Report&#8212;that the community should use its full
powers of compulsion only in regard to the
<a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a><span class="pagenum" title="158"></span>minimum, and that so far as all other classes of
wages are concerned, the State should encourage
collective bargaining. With this proviso, compulsory
enforcement of a minimum could also be extended
to the workpeople covered by Whitley Councils.</p>

<p>As regards all wages above the minimum the
Cave Committee recommended that, provided they
are reached by agreement on the Board, and
provided that a sufficiently large proportion of the
Board concur, the wage so determined shall be
enforced by civil process, whereas in the cases of
the minimum, the rates would be determined if
necessary by arbitration of the State-appointed
members of the Board, and non-payment would
be a penal offence. The Trade Boards now cover
three million workers. Two million are in occupations
for which Trade Boards are under consideration,
and there are a further two million under
Industrial Councils or Whitley Councils. If State
powers are to be employed in trades employing
seven millions of the eighteen million wage-earners
of the country, the scope of those powers needs
to be very carefully defined.</p>


<h3>The Case for Profit-Sharing</h3>

<p>Many Liberals are, however, asking whether
this is sufficient and whether it is not possible for
the State to intervene to alter the distribution
of the product of industry in favour of the wage-earner.
In particular, they are wondering whether
it is possible to secure the universal application
of some system of profit-sharing. The underlying
<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a><span class="pagenum" title="159"></span>principle of profit-sharing is indeed one which we
must look to if the whole-hearted assistance of
labour is to be enlisted behind the productive
effort of the country. But the profit we have to
consider is the profit over which the worker has
some influence. There is no merit in inviting
him to share in purely commercial profits or
losses which may be due to some one else&#8217;s
speculation or business foresight. It is futile to
imagine you can reverse the functions of labour
and capital, and say that capital should have a
fixed wage, and that the employee should bear all
the risks of the industry.</p>

<p>Again, in some cases it is suitable that profits
should be considered in regard to a whole industry,
but in others only in regard to a particular firm
or section; and finally the rate of profit suitable
to various trades varies between very wide limits.
In short, there can be no universal rule in this
matter which can be enforced by Act of Parliament.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we must all desire to proceed
along the lines of associating the pecuniary interests
of the worker in the success of the enterprise, and
if any one can suggest a way in which direct
assistance to that end can be given by political
action, as distinct from industrial, he will be doing
a great service. I may add that there is an argument
in favour of profit-sharing which is of the utmost
importance and which was recently expressed by
a prominent industrialist: who declared to me
that at long last and after much opposition he has
come round to believe in profit-sharing, <em>because it
enables him to show his men the balance sheet</em>. The
<a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a><span class="pagenum" title="160"></span>solution adopted last year in the mining industry
contains the sort of elements we wish to see adopted
in principle. The men are given, through their
officials, the results of the industry. They see
that they cannot get more than the industry can
pay, and though the present economic conditions
are putting the men in a desperate state to-day,
the miners, who were often regarded before the war
as the most pugnacious in the country, are not
burning their employers&#8217; houses, but are studying
how the economic conditions of the industry can
be improved for the benefit of themselves and
their employers.</p>


<h3>Industrial Publicity</h3>

<p>This brings me to the question of publicity,
which is at the root of the whole problem. We
desire the principle of private enterprise to remain.
The one thing that can destroy it is secrecy. We
argue that the self-interest of the investor makes
capital flow into those channels where economic
conditions need it most. But how can the investor
know where it should go when the true financial
condition of great industrial companies is a matter
of guesswork? Again, we rely upon our bankers
to check excessive industrial fluctuations. How
can they do this if they do not know the facts of
production? The public should know what great
combines are doing, but they do not know; and
how can we expect the man in the street to be
satisfied when his mind is filled with suspicions
that can be neither confirmed nor removed?</p>

<p><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a><span class="pagenum" title="161"></span>It is of the utmost importance to seek for greater
publicity on two main lines. The illustration of
the mines suggests one&#8212;production and wage data.
There are only three industries in this country&#8212;coal,
steel, and ships&#8212;in which production statistics
exist. I suggest that in many of our great staple
industries a few simple data with regard to production
should be published promptly, say every
three months. The data I have in mind are the
wages bill, the cost of materials, and the value of
the product. It is desirable that this should be
done, and I believe it can be done, for almost
every great industry in the country. These three
facts alone will bring the whole wages discussion
down to earth.</p>

<p>Then on finance, I suggest that one of the first
things a Liberal Government should do should be
to appoint a commission to overhaul the whole of
our Company Law. This is not the occasion to enter
in detail into a highly technical problem. But I
would call attention to the following points: There
is no compulsion on any joint-stock company to
publish a balance sheet. It is almost the universal
practice to do so; but as it is not an obligation,
the Company Law lays down no rules as to what
published balance sheets must contain. Again, the
difference between private and public companies
must be considered; a private company which
employs a great mass of capital and large numbers
of work-people&#8212;a concern which may cover a
whole town or district&#8212;should in the public
interest be subject to the same rules as a public
company. Thirdly, in view of the amalgamation
<a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a><span class="pagenum" title="162"></span>of industry, the linking up of company with company,
there must be reconsideration as regards
publicity in the case of subsidiary companies.
Finally, I think we have been wrong in assuming
that a law applicable to a company with a modest
little capital is suitable to regulate the publicity
of a great combine controlling tens of millions of
capital. Some attempt should therefore be made
to differentiate between what must be told by the
big and by the little concerns respectively. I am
well aware of the myriad difficulties that this
demand for publicity will encounter. But difficulties
exist to be overcome. And they must be overcome,
for of this I feel certain: that if the system of
private enterprise dies, it will be because the canker
of secrecy has eaten into its vitals.</p>


<h3>A National Industrial Council</h3>

<p>I have left very little time for dealing specifically
with the question of industrial relations, though
much that I have said has a bearing upon it. There
has been great disappointment with the results of
the Whitley Council movement. Many thought
they were going to bring in a new era. But they
have not lived up to these hopes, firstly, because
they came into being at a time of unexampled
economic difficulty, and, secondly, because they
were introduced into industries where there was
no tradition of co-operative action&#8212;being established
mainly in industries lying between the
entirely unorganised and the highly organised
trades. But we must persist in encouraging
<a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a><span class="pagenum" title="163"></span>Whitley Councils, and still more in the associated
objective of encouraging works committees. The
basis of industrial peace is in the individual works.
Co-operation cannot be created by Act of Parliament,
but depends upon the development of
opinion among employers and workmen. Starting
from Works Councils up through the Whitley
Council, Trade Boards, or National Trade Union
machinery for the negotiation of wages, we arrive
at the National Industrial Council, which is the
point at which the Government can most directly
assist the movement towards more cordial relations.
The plan of this Council is ready. It was proposed
and developed in 1919, and I personally do
not want to change that plan very much.</p>

<p>But I think it is of the utmost importance that
we should embody in our Liberal programme the
institution of a National Industrial Council or
Parliament representing the trade organisations
on both sides. Whether it should represent the
consumers, I, personally, am doubtful. It should be
consulted before economic and particularly industrial
legislation is introduced into Parliament. It should
be the forum on which we should get a much
better informed discussion of industrial problems
than is possible in Parliament or through any
other agency in the country. The National Council
also needs to have specific work to do. I would
be prepared to see transferred to it many of the
functions of the Ministry of Labour, or rather that
it should be made obligatory for the Minister of
Labour to consult this Council on such questions
as whether it should hold a compulsory inquiry
<a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a><span class="pagenum" title="164"></span>into an industrial dispute. I would also throw
upon it the duty of advising Parliament exactly
how my proposals as to publicity are to be carried
out, and would give it responsibility for the
Ministry of Labour index figures of the cost of
living upon which so many industrial agreements
depend. I believe if we could set out a series of
specific functions to give the plan vitality, in
addition to the more nebulous duty of advising the
Government on industrial questions, we should
have created an important device for promoting
the mutual confidence of which I have spoken.</p>

<p>The suggestions I have made are perhaps not
very new, but they seem to me to be in the natural
line of evolution of Liberal traditions. Above all,
if they are accepted they should be pursued unflinchingly
and persevered with, not as a concession
to this or that section which may happen to be
strong at the moment, but as a corporate policy,
which aims at combining the interests of us all in
securing increased national wealth with justice to
the component classes of the commonwealth.</p>

<h2><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a><span class="pagenum" title="165"></span><a name="THE_REGULATION_OF_WAGES" id="THE_REGULATION_OF_WAGES"></a>THE REGULATION OF WAGES</h2>

<h3>By Professor L.T. Hobhouse</h3>

<h4>Professor of Sociology, London University.</h4>


<p>Professor Hobhouse said:&#8212;The wages, hours,
and general conditions of industrial workers are
of interest to the community from two points of
view. So far as the less skilled and lower paid
workers are concerned, it is to the interest and it
is the duty of the community to protect them from
oppression, and to secure that every one of its
members, who is willing and able to contribute
honest and industrious work to the service of others,
should be able in return to gain the means of a
decent and civilised life. In this relation the
establishment of a minimum wage is analogous to
the restriction of hours or the provision for safety
and health secured by Factory Legislation, and
carries forward the provision for a minimum
standard of life. The problem is to determine
upon the minimum and adjust its enforcement
to the conditions of trade in such wise as to avoid
industrial dislocation and consequent unemployment.</p>

<p>With regard to workers of higher skill, who
command wages or salaries on a more generous
scale, the interest of the community is of a different
kind. Such workers hardly stand in need of any
<a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a><span class="pagenum" title="166"></span>special protection. They are well able to take care
of themselves, and sometimes through combination
are, in fact, the stronger party in the industrial
bargain. In this region the interest of the community
lies in maintaining industrial peace and
securing the maximum of goodwill and co-operation.
The intervention of the community in industrial
disputes, however, has never been very popular
with either party in the State. Both sides to a
dispute are inclined to trust to their own strength,
and are only ready to submit to an impartial
judgment when convinced that they are momentarily
the weaker. Nor is it easy when we once get above
the minimum to lay down any general principles
which a court of arbitration could apply in grading
wages.</p>

<p>For these reasons the movement for compulsory
arbitration has never in this country advanced very
far. We have an Industrial Court which can
investigate a dispute, find a solution which commends
itself as reasonable, and publish its finding,
but without any power of enforcement. The
movement has for the present stuck there, and is
likely to take a long time to get further. Yet every
one recognises the damage inflicted by industrial
disputes, and would admit in the abstract the
desirability of a more rational method of settlement
than that of pitting combination against combination.
Such a method may, I would suggest, grow
naturally out of the system which has been devised
for the protection of unskilled and unorganised
workers, of which a brief account may now be
given.</p>


<h3><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a><span class="pagenum" title="167"></span>The Establishment of Trade Boards</h3>

<p>Utilising experience gained in Australia, Parliament
in 1909 passed an Act empowering the Board
of Trade (now the Ministry of Labour) to establish
a Trade Board in any case where the rate of wages
prevailing in any branch was &#8220;exceptionally low
as compared with that in other employments.&#8221;
The Board consisted of a number of persons selected
by the Minister as representatives of employers,
an equal number as representatives of the workers,
with a chairman and generally two colleagues not
associated with the trade, and known as the
Appointed Members. These three members hold
a kind of casting vote, and can in general secure a
decision if the sides disagree.</p>

<p>No instruction was given in the statute as to the
principles on which the Board should determine
wages, but the Board has necessarily in mind on
the one side the requirements of the worker, and
on the other the economic position of the trade.
The workers&#8217; representatives naturally emphasise
the one aspect and the employers the other, but the
appointed members and the Board as a whole must
take account of both. They must consider what
the trade in general can afford to pay and yet
continue to prosper and to give full employment
to the workers. They must also consider the rate
at which the worker can pay his way and live a
decent, civilised life. Mere subsistence is not
enough. It is a cardinal point of economic justice
that a well-organised society will enable a man to
<a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a><span class="pagenum" title="168"></span>earn the means of living as a healthy, developed,
civilised being by honest and useful service to the
community. I would venture to add that in a
perfectly organised society he would not be able&#8212;charitable
provision apart&#8212;to make a living by
any other method. There is nothing in these
principles to close the avenues to personal initiative
or to deny a career to ability and enterprise. On
the contrary, it is a point of justice that such
qualities should have their scope, but not to the
injury of others. For this, I suggest with confidence
to a Liberal audience, is the condition by which all
liberty must be defined.<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>If we grant that it is the duty of the Boards to
aim at a decent minimum&#8212;one which in Mr.
Seebohm Rowntree&#8217;s phrase would secure the
&#8220;human needs&#8221; of labour&#8212;we have still some
very difficult points of principle and of detail to
settle. First and foremost, do we mean the needs
of the individual worker or of a family, and if of the
latter, how large a family? It has been generally
thought that a man&#8217;s wages should suffice for a
family on the ground that there ought to be no
economic compulsion&#8212;though there should be
full legal and social liberty&#8212;for the mother to
eke out deficiencies in the father&#8217;s payment
by going out to work. It has also been thought
that a woman is not ordinarily under a similar
obligation to maintain a family, so that her
&#8220;human needs&#8221; would be met by a wage
<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a><span class="pagenum" title="169"></span>sufficient to maintain herself as an independent
individual.</p>

<p>These views have been attacked as involving a
differentiation unfair in the first instance to women,
but in the second instance to men, because opening
a way to undercutting. The remedy proposed is
public provision for children under the industrial
age, and for the mother in return for her work in
looking after them. With this subvention, it is conceived,
the rates for men or women might be equalised
on the basis of a sufficiency for the individual alone.
This would certainly simplify the wages question,
but at the cost of a serious financial question. I do
not, myself, think that &#8220;human needs&#8221; can be
fully met without the common provision of certain
essentials for children. One such essential&#8212;education,
has been long recognised as too costly to be
put upon the wages of the worker. We may find
that we shall have to add to the list if we are to
secure to growing children all that the community
would desire for them. On the other hand, the
main responsibility for directing its own life should
be left to each family, and this carries the consequence,
that the adult-man&#8217;s wage should be
based not on personal but on family requirements.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_1_2" id="Footnote_1_2"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_1_2">[1]</a></span> I may perhaps be allowed to refer to my <em>Elements of Social
Justice</em>, Allen &amp; Unwin, 1921, for the fuller elaboration of
these principles.</p>


<h3>Women&#8217;s Wages</h3>

<p>But the supposed injustice to woman is illusory.
Trade Boards will not knowingly fix women&#8217;s
rates at a point at which they can undercut men.
Nor if women are properly represented on them
will they fix their rates at a point at which women
<a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a><span class="pagenum" title="170"></span>will be discarded in favour of male workers. In
industries where both sexes are employed, if the
women workers are of equal value with the men in
the eyes of the employer, they will receive equal
pay; if of less value, then, but only then, proportionately
less pay. It is because women have
received not proportionately but quite disproportionately
less pay that they have been undercutting
men, and the Trade Boards are&#8212;very
gradually, I admit&#8212;correcting this error. For well-known
historical reasons women have been at an
economic disadvantage, and their work has secured
less than its worth as compared with the work of
men. The tendency of any impartial adjustment
of wages is to correct this disadvantage, because
any such system will attempt to secure equality
of opportunity for employment for all the classes
with which it is dealing. But it is admitted that
there is a &#8220;lag&#8221; in women&#8217;s wages which has been
but partially made good.</p>

<p>If the standard wage must provide for a family,
what must be the size of the family? Discussion
on the subject generally assumes a &#8220;statistical&#8221;
family of man and wife and three children under
age. This is criticised on the ground that it does
not meet the human needs of larger families and
is in excess for smaller ones. The reply to this is
that a general rate can only meet general needs.
Calculation easily shows that the minimum suited
for three children is by no means extravagant if
there should be but two children or only one, while
it gives the bachelor or newly married couple some
small chance of getting a little beforehand with
<a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a><span class="pagenum" title="171"></span>the world. On the other hand, it is impossible to
cater on general principles for the larger needs of
individuals. The standard wage gives an approximation
to what is needed for the ordinary family,
and the balance must be made good by other
provision, whether public or private I will not here
discuss. I conclude that for adult men the minimum
is reasonably fixed at a figure which would
meet the &#8220;human needs&#8221; of a family of five,
and that for women it should be determined by
the value of their services relatively to that of
men.<a name="FNanchor_1_3" id="FNanchor_1_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_3" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>How far have Trade Boards actually succeeded
in fixing such a minimum? Mr. Seebohm Rowntree
has put forward two sets of figures based on pre-war
prices, and, of course, requiring adjustment
for the changes that have subsequently taken place.
One of these figures was designed for a subsistence
wage, the other for a &#8220;human needs&#8221; wage. The
latter was a figure which Mr. Rowntree himself
did not expect to see reached in the near future.
I have compared these figures with the actual
minima for unskilled workers fixed by the Boards
during 1920 and 1921, and I find that the rates
fixed are intermediate between the two. The subsistence
rate is passed, but the higher rate not
attained, except for some classes of skilled workers.
<a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a><span class="pagenum" title="172"></span>The Boards have in general proceeded with moderation,
but the more serious forms of underpayment
have been suppressed so far as inspection has been
adequately enforced. The ratio of the female to
the male minimum averages 57.2 per cent., which
may seem unduly low, but it must be remembered
that in the case of women&#8217;s wages a much greater
leeway had to be made good, and there can be
little doubt that the increases secured for female
workers considerably exceeded those obtained for
men.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_1_3" id="Footnote_1_3"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_1_3">[1]</a></span> I am assuming that this value is sufficient to cover the
needs of the independent woman worker. If not, these needs
must also be taken into account. As a fact both considerations
are present to the minds of the Trade Boards. A Board would
not willingly fix a wage which would either (<em>a</em>) diminish the
opportunity of women to obtain employment, or (<em>b</em>) enable
them to undercut men, or (<em>c</em>) fail to provide for them if living
alone.</p>


<h3>The Question of a Single Minimum</h3>

<p>Criticism of Trade Boards has fastened on their
power to determine higher rates of wages for
skilled workers, one of the additional powers that
they secured under the Act of 1918. There are
many who agree that a bare minimum should be
fixed by a statutory authority with legal powers,
but think that this should be the beginning and
end of law&#8217;s interference. As to this, it must be said,
first, that the wide margin between a subsistence
wage and a human needs wage, brought out by
Mr. Rowntree&#8217;s calculations, shows that there can
be no question at present of a single minimum.
To give the &#8220;human needs&#8221; figure legislative
sanction would at present be Utopian. Very few
Trade Boards ventured so far even when trade
was booming. The Boards move in the region
between bare subsistence and &#8220;human needs,&#8221;
as trade conditions allow, and can secure a better
figure for some classes of their clients when they
<a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a><span class="pagenum" title="173"></span>cannot secure it for all. They therefore need all
the elasticity which the present law gives them.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is contended with some
force by the Cave Committee that it is improper for
appointed members to decide questions of relatively
high wages for skilled men or for the law to enforce
such wages by criminal proceedings, and the
Committee accordingly propose to differentiate
between higher and lower minima both as regards
the method of determination and of enforcement.
I have not time here to discuss the details of their
proposal, but I wish to say a word on the retention&#8212;if
in some altered shape&#8212;of the powers given
by the Act of 1918. The Trade Board system
has been remarkable for the development of understanding
and co-operation between representatives
of employers and workers. Particularly in the
work of the administrative committees, matters
of detail which might easily excite controversy
and passion are habitually handled with coolness
and good sense in the common interest of the
trade. A number of the employers have not merely
acquiesced in the system, but have become its
convinced supporters, and this attitude would be
more common if certain irritating causes of friction
were removed. The employer who desires to treat
his workers well and maintain good conditions
is relieved from the competition of rivals who care
little for these things, and what he is chiefly concerned
about is simplicity of rules and rigid universality
of enforcement. It is this section of
employers who have prevented the crippling of
the Boards in a time of general reaction. It is
<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a><span class="pagenum" title="174"></span>blindness to refuse to see in such co-operation a
possible basis of industrial peace, and those were
right who in 1918 saw in the mechanism of the
Boards the possibility, not merely of preventing
industrial oppression and securing a minimum
living wage, but of advancing to a general regulation
of industrial relations. At that time it was thought
that the whole of industry might be divided between
Trade Boards and Whitley Councils, the former
for the less, the latter for the more organised trades.
In the result the Whitley Councils have proved to
be hampered if not paralysed by the lack of an
independent element and of compulsory powers.</p>


<h3>Trade Boards Holding the Field</h3>

<p>The Trade Board holds the field as the best
machinery for the determination of industrial
conditions. It is better than unfettered competition,
which leaves the weak at the mercy of the strong.
It is better than the contest of armed forces, in
which the battle is decided with no reference to
equity, to permanent economic conditions, or to
the general good, by the main strength of one
combination or the other in the circumstances of
the moment. It is better than a universal State-determined
wages-law which would take no account
of fluctuating industrial conditions, and better than
official determinations which are exposed to political
influences and are apt to ignore the technicalities
which only the practical worker or employer understands.
It is better than arbitration, which acts
intermittently and incalculably from outside, and
<a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a><span class="pagenum" title="175"></span>makes no call on the continuous co-operation of
the trade itself.</p>

<p>My hope is that as the true value of the Trade
Board comes to be better understood, its powers,
far from being jealously curtailed, or confined to
the suppression of the worst form of underpayment,
will be extended to skilled employments, and
organised industries, and be used not merely to
fulfil the duty of the community to its humblest
members, but to serve its still wider interest in the
development of peaceful industrial co-operation.</p>

<h2><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a><span class="pagenum" title="176"></span><a name="UNEMPLOYMENT" id="UNEMPLOYMENT"></a>UNEMPLOYMENT</h2>

<h3>By H.D. Henderson</h3>

<h4>M.A.; Fellow of Clare College, Cambridge; Lecturer in
Economics; Secretary to the Cotton Control Board
from 1917-1919.</h4>


<p>Mr. Henderson said:&#8212;From one point of view
the existence of an unemployment problem is an
enigma and a paradox. In a world, where even before
the war the standard of living that prevailed among
the mass of the people was only what it was, even in
those countries which we termed wealthy, it seems
at first sight an utterly astonishing anomaly that
at frequent intervals large numbers of competent
and industrious work-people should find no work
to do. The irony of the situation cannot be more
tersely expressed than in the words, which a man
is supposed to have uttered as he watched a procession
of unemployed men: &#8220;No work to do.
Set them to rebuild their own houses.&#8221;</p>

<p>But, if we reflect just a shade more deeply,
nothing should surprise us less than unemployment.
We have more reason for surprise that it is usually
upon so small a scale. The economic system under
which we live in the modern world is very peculiar
and only our familiarity with it keeps us from perceiving
how peculiar it is. In one sense it is highly
organised; in another sense it is not organised
at all. There is an elaborate differentiation of
<a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a><span class="pagenum" title="177"></span>functions&#8212;the &#8220;division of labour,&#8221; to give it its
time-honoured name, under which innumerable men
and women perform each small specialised tasks,
which fit into one another with the complexity of
a jig-saw puzzle, to form an integral whole. Some
men dig coal from the depths of the earth, others
move that coal over land by rail and over the seas
in ships, others are working in factories, at home and
abroad, which consume that coal, or in shipyards
which build the ships; and it is obvious, not to
multiply examples further, that the numbers of
men engaged on those various tasks must somehow
be adjusted, <em>in due proportions</em> to one another.
It is no use, for instance, building more ships than
are required to carry the stuff there is to carry.</p>

<p>Adjustment, co-ordination, must somehow be
secured. Well, how is it secured? Who is it that
ordains that, say, a million men shall work in the
coal-mines, and 600,000 on the railways, and 200,000
in the shipyards, and so on? Who apportions the
nation&#8217;s labour power between the innumerable
different occupations, so as to secure that there are
not too many and not too few engaged in any one
of them relatively to the others? Is it the Prime
Minister, or the Cabinet, or Parliament, or the
Civil Service? Is it the Trade Union Congress, or
the Federation of British Industries, or does any
one suppose that it is some hidden cabal of big
business interests? No, there is no co-ordinator.
There is no human brain or organisation responsible
for fitting together this vast jig-saw puzzle; and,
that being so, I say that what should really excite
our wonder is the fact that that puzzle should
<a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a><span class="pagenum" title="178"></span>somehow get fitted together, usually with so few
gaps left unfilled and with so few pieces left unplaced.</p>

<p>It would, indeed, be a miracle, if it were not for
the fact that those old economic laws, whose impersonal
forces of supply and demand, whose
existence some people nowadays are inclined to
dispute, or to regard as being in extremely bad
taste, really do work in a manner after all. They
are our co-ordinators, the only ones we have; and
they do their work with much friction and waste,
only by correcting a maladjustment after it has
taken place, by slow and often cruel devices, of
which one of the most cruel is, precisely, unemployment
and all the misery it entails.</p>


<h3>The Causes of Trade Depressions</h3>

<p>I do not propose to deal with such branches of
the problem of unemployment as casual labour or
seasonal fluctuations. I confine myself to what
we all, I suppose, feel to be the really big problem,
to unemployment which is not special to particular
industries or districts, but which is common to
them all, to a general depression of almost every
form of business and industrial activity. General
trade depressions are no new phenomenon, though
the present depression is, of course, far worse than
any we have experienced in modern times. They
used to occur so regularly that long before the war
people had come to speak of cyclical fluctuations,
or to use a phrase which is now common, the trade
cycle. That is a useful phrase, and a useful conception.
It is well that we should realise, when
<a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a><span class="pagenum" title="179"></span>we speak of those normal pre-war conditions, to
which we hope some day to revert, that in a sense
trade conditions never were normal; that, at any
particular moment you care to take, we were
either in full tide of a trade boom, with employment
active and prices rising, and order books
congested; or else right on the crest of the boom,
when prices were no longer rising generally, though
they had not yet commenced to fall, when employment
was still good, but when new orders were no
longer coming in; or else in the early stages of a
depression, with prices falling, and every one trying
to unload stocks and failing to do so, and works
beginning to close down; or else right in the
trough of the depression where we are to-day;
that we were at one or other of the innumerable
stages of the trade cycle, without any prospect of
remaining there for very long, but always, as it
were, in motion, going round and round and round.</p>

<p>What are the root causes which bring every
period of active trade to an inevitable end? There
are two which are almost <a name="typo_4" id="typo_4"></a>invariably present towards
the end of every boom. First, the general level of
prices and wages has usually become too high; it
is straining against the limits of the available
supplies of currency and credit, and, unless inflation
is to be permitted, a restriction of credit is inevitable
which will bring on a trade depression. In
those circumstances, a reduction of the general
level of prices and wages is an essential condition of
a trade revival. A reduction of prices <em>and wages</em>.
That point has a significance to which I will return.</p>

<p>The second cause is the distorted balance which
<a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a><span class="pagenum" title="180"></span>grows up in every boom between different branches
of industrial activity. When trade is good, we
invariably build ships, produce machinery, erect
factories, make every variety of what are termed
&#8220;constructional goods&#8221; upon a scale which is
altogether disproportionate to the scale upon which
we are making &#8220;consumable goods&#8221; like food and
clothes. And that condition of things could not
possibly endure for very long. If it were to continue
indefinitely, it would lead in the end to our having,
say, half a dozen ships for every ton of wheat or
cotton which there was to carry. You have there
a maladjustment, which must be corrected somehow;
and the longer the readjustment is postponed,
the bigger the readjustment that will
ultimately be inevitable. Now that means, first
on the negative side, that, when you are confronted
with a trade depression, it is hopeless to try to
cure it by looking for some device by which you
can give a general stimulus to all forms of industry.
Devices of that nature may be very useful in the
later stages of a trade depression, when the necessary
readjustments both of the price-level and of the
relative outputs of different classes of commodities
have already been effected, and when trade remains
depressed only because people have not yet plucked
up the necessary confidence to start things going
again. But in the early stages of a depression, an
indiscriminating stimulus to industry in general
will serve only to perpetuate the maladjustments
which are the root of the trouble. It will only put
off the evil day, and make it worse when it comes.
The problem is not one of getting everybody back
<a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a><span class="pagenum" title="181"></span>to work on their former jobs. It is one of getting
them set to work on the <em>right</em> jobs; and that is a
far more difficult matter.</p>

<p>On the positive side, what this really comes to
is, that if you wish to prevent depressions occurring
you must prevent booms taking the form they do.
You must prevent prices rising so much, and so
many constructional goods being made during the
period of active trade; and I am not going to
pretend that that is an easy thing to do. It&#8217;s all
very well to say that the bankers, through their
control of the credit system, might endeavour to
guide industry and keep it from straying out of
the proper channels. But the bankers would
have to know much more than they do about these
matters, and, furthermore, the problem is not
merely a national one&#8212;it is a world-wide problem.
It would be of little use to prevent an excess of
ships being built here, if that only meant that still
more ships were built, say, in the United States.</p>

<p>I do not say that even now the banks might
not do something which would help; still less
do I wish to convey the impression that mankind
must always remain passive and submissive,
impotent to control these forces which so vitally
affect his welfare. But I say that for any serious
attempt to master this problem, the necessary
detailed knowledge has still to be acquired, and the
rudiments of organisation have still to be built up;
and the problem is not one at this stage for policies
and programmes. What you can do by means of
policies and programmes lies, at present, in the
sphere of international politics. In that sphere,
<a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a><span class="pagenum" title="182"></span>though you cannot achieve all, you might achieve
much. To reduce the problem to its pre-war
dimensions would be no small result; and that
represents a big enough objective, for the time
being, for the concentration of our hardest thinking
and united efforts. But into that sphere I am not
going to enter. I pass to the problem of unemployment
relief.</p>


<h3>The Scale of Relief</h3>

<p>The fundamental difficulty of the problem of
relieving unemployment is a very old one. It
turns upon what used to be called, ninety years
ago, &#8220;the principle of less eligibility,&#8221; the principle
that the position of the man who is unemployed
and receiving support from the community should
be made upon the whole less eligible, less attractive
than that of the man who is working and living
upon the wages that he earns. That is a principle
which has been exposed to much criticism and
denunciation in these modern days. We are told
that it is the false and antiquated doctrine of a
hard-hearted and coarse-minded age, which thought
that unemployment was usually a man&#8217;s own
fault, which saw a malingerer in every recipient of
relief, which was obsessed by the bad psychology
of pains and penalties and looked instinctively
for a deterrent as the cure for every complex evil.</p>

<p>But, however that may be, this principle of less
eligibility is one which you cannot ignore. It is
not merely or mainly a matter of the effect on
the character of the workmen who receive relief.
<a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a><span class="pagenum" title="183"></span>The danger that adequate relief will demoralise
the recipient has, I agree, been grossly exaggerated
in the past. Prolonged unemployment is always
in itself demoralising. But, given that a man is
unemployed, it will not demoralise him more that
he should receive adequate relief rather than
inadequate relief or no relief at all. On the contrary,
on balance, it will, I believe, demoralise him less.
For nothing so unfits a man for work as that he
should go half-starved, or lack the means to maintain
the elementary decencies of life.</p>

<p>But there are other considerations which you
have to take into account. If you get a situation
such that the man who loses his job becomes
thereby much better-off than the man who remains
at work, I do not say that the former man will
necessarily be demoralised, but I do say that the
latter man will become disgruntled. I do not want
to put that consideration too high. At the present
time there are many such anomalies; in a great
many occupations, the wages that the men at work
are receiving amount to much less than the money
they would obtain if they lost their jobs and were
labelled unemployed. But they have stuck to
their jobs, they are carrying on, with a patience
and good humour that are beyond all praise. Yes,
but that state of affairs is so anomalous, so contrary
to our elementary sense of fairness that, as a
permanent proposition it would prove intolerable.
We cannot go on for ever with a system under
which in many trades men receive much more when
they are unemployed than when they are at work.
On the other hand, the attempt to avoid such
<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a><span class="pagenum" title="184"></span>anomalies leads us, so long as we have a uniform
scale of relief, against an alternative which is
equally intolerable. Wages vary greatly from
trade to trade; and, if the scale of relief is not to
exceed the wages paid in <em>any</em> occupation it must
be very low indeed. That is the root dilemma of
the problem of unemployment relief&#8212;how if your
scale of relief is not to be too high for equity and
prudence it is not to be too low for humanity and
decency. We have not, as some people imagine,
done anything in recent years to escape from it,
we have merely exchanged one horn of the dilemma
for the other.</p>

<p>In any satisfactory system the scale of relief must
vary from occupation to occupation, in accordance
with the normal standard of wages ruling in each
case. But it is very difficult, in fact I think it
would always be impracticable to do that under
any system of relief, administered by the State,
either the Central Government or the local authorities.
It must be done on an industrial basis; each
industry settling its own scale, finding its own
money, and managing its own scheme. That is an
idea which has received much ventilation in the
last few years. But the really telling arguments
in favour of it do not seem to me to have received
sufficient stress.</p>

<p>Foremost among them I place the consideration
I have just indicated: that in this way, and in
this way alone, it becomes possible for work-people
who receive high wages when they are at work,
and where habits of expenditure and standards of
family living are built up on that basis, to receive
<a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a><span class="pagenum" title="185"></span>when unemployed, adequate relief without that
leading to anomalies which in the long run would
prove intolerable. But there are many other
arguments.</p>


<h3>A Model Scheme from Lancashire</h3>

<p>About five years ago I had the opportunity of
witnessing at very close quarters the working of
an unemployment scheme on an industrial basis.
The great Lancashire cotton industry was faced
during the war with a very serious unemployment
problem, owing to the difficulty of transporting
sufficient cotton from America. It met that
situation with a scheme of unemployment relief,
devised and administered by one of those war
Control Boards, which in this case was essentially
a representative joint committee of employers
and employed. The money was raised, every
penny of it, from the employers in the industry
itself; the Cotton Control Board laid down certain
rules and regulations as to the scale of benefits,
and the conditions entitling a worker to receive it;
and the task of applying those rules and paying
the money out was entrusted to the trade unions.</p>

<p>Well, I was in a good position to watch that
experiment. I do not think I am a particularly
credulous person, or one prone to indulge in easy
enthusiasms, and I certainly don&#8217;t believe in
painting a fairy picture in glowing colours by way
of being encouraging. But I say deliberately that
there has never been an unemployment scheme
in this country or in any other country which has
<a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a><span class="pagenum" title="186"></span>worked with so little abuse, with so few anomalies,
with so little demoralisation to any one, and at
the same time which has met so adequately the
needs of a formidable situation, or given such
general satisfaction all round as that Cotton Control
Board scheme.</p>

<p>I cannot describe as fully as I should like to do
the various features which made that scheme
attractive, and made it a success. I will take just
one by way of illustration. It is technically possible
in the cotton trade to work the mills with relays of
workers, so that if a mill has 100 work-people, and
can only employ 80 work-people each week, the
whole 100 can work each for four weeks out of the
five, and &#8220;play off,&#8221; as it is called, in regular
sequence for the fifth week. And that was what
was done for a long time. It was called the &#8220;rota&#8221;
system; and the &#8220;rota&#8221; week of &#8220;playing off&#8221;
became a very popular institution. Under that
system, benefits which would have been far from
princely as the sole source of income week after
week&#8212;they never amounted to more than 30/- for
a man and 18/- for a woman&#8212;assumed a much
more liberal aspect. For they came only as the
occasional variants of full wages; and they were
accompanied not by the depressing circumstances
of long-continued unemployment, but by what is
psychologically an entirely different and positively
exhilarating thing, a full week&#8217;s holiday. That
meant that the available resources&#8212;and one of
the difficulties of any scheme of unemployment
relief is that the resources available are always
limited&#8212;did much more to prevent misery and
<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a><span class="pagenum" title="187"></span>distress, and went much further towards fulfilling
all the objects of an unemployment scheme than
would have been possible otherwise.</p>

<p>That system was possible in the cotton trade; in
other trades it might be impossible for technical
reasons, or, where possible, it might in certain
circumstances be highly undesirable. The point
I wish to stress is that under an industrial scheme
you have an immense flexibility, you can adapt
all the details to the special conditions of the
particular industry, and by that means you can
secure results immeasurably superior to anything
that is possible under a universal State system.
Moreover, if certain features of the scheme should
prove in practice unsatisfactory, they can be
altered with comparatively little difficulty. You
don&#8217;t need to be so desperately afraid of the possibility
of making a mistake as you must when it is
a case of a great national scheme, which can only
be altered by Act of Parliament.</p>


<h3>The Moral Obligation of Industries</h3>

<p>I do not underrate the difficulty of applying
this principle of industrial relief over the whole
field of industry. There is the great difficulty of
defining an industry, or drawing the lines of
demarcation between one trade and another. I
have not time to elaborate those difficulties, but
I consider that they constitute an insuperable
obstacle to anything in the nature of an Act of
Parliament, which would impose forcibly upon
each industry the obligation to work out an
<a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a><span class="pagenum" title="188"></span>unemployment scheme. The initiative must come
from within the industry; the organisations of
employers and employed must get together and
work out their own scheme, on their own responsibility
and with a free hand. And, if it happens in
this way&#8212;one industry taking the lead and others
following&#8212;these difficulties of demarcation become
comparatively unimportant. You can let an
industry define itself more or less as it likes, and it
does not matter much if its distinctions are somewhat
arbitrary. It is not a fatal drawback if
some firms and work-people are left outside who
would like to be brought in. And if there are two
industries which overlap one another, each of
which is contemplating a scheme of the kind, it is
a comparatively simple matter for the responsible
bodies in the two industries to agree with one
another as to the lines of demarcation between
them, as was actually done during the war by the
Cotton Control Board and the Wool Control Board,
with practically no difficulty whatever. But for
such agreements to work smoothly it is essential
that the industries concerned should be anxious to
make their schemes a success; and that is another
reason why you cannot impose this policy by
<em>force majeure</em> upon a reluctant trade. It is in
the field of industry that the real move must be
made.</p>

<p>But I think that Parliament and the Government
might come in to the picture. In the first place,
the ordinary national system of unemployment
relief, which must in any case continue, might be
so framed as to encourage rather than to discourage
<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a><span class="pagenum" title="189"></span>the institution of industrial schemes. Under the
Insurance Act of 1920 &#8220;contracting out&#8221; was
provided for, but it was penalised, while at the
present moment it is prohibited altogether. I say
that it should rather be encouraged, that everything
should be done, in fact, to suggest that not
a legal but a moral obligation lies upon each industry
to do its best to work out a satisfactory unemployment
scheme. And, when an industry has done
that, I think the State should come in again. I
think that the representative joint committee,
formed to administer such a scheme, might well
be endowed by statute with a formal status, and
certain clearly-defined powers&#8212;such as the Cotton
Control Board possessed during the war&#8212;of enforcing
its decisions.</p>

<p>But&#8212;and, of course, there is a &#8220;but&#8221;&#8212;we
cannot expect very much from this in the near
future. We must wait for better trade conditions
before we begin; and, as I have already indicated,
the prospects of really good trade in the next few
years are none too well assured. For a long time
to come, it is clear, we must rely upon the ordinary
State machinery for the provision of unemployment
relief; and, of course, the machinery of the State
will always be required to cover a large part of the
ground. The liability which an industry assumes
must necessarily be strictly limited in point of time;
and there are many occupations in which it will
probably always prove impracticable for the occupation
to assume even a temporary liability. For the
meantime, at any rate, we must rely mainly upon
the State machinery. Is it possible to improve upon
<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a><span class="pagenum" title="190"></span>the present working of this machinery? I think
it is. By the State machinery I mean not merely
the Central Government, but the local authorities
and the local Boards of Guardians.</p>


<h3>The Present Machinery of Relief</h3>

<p>At present what is the situation? Most unemployed
work-people are entitled to receive certain
payments from the Employment Exchanges under
a so-called Insurance scheme, which is administered
on a national basis; some weeks they are entitled
to receive those payments, other weeks they are
not; but in any case those payments afford relief
which is admittedly inadequate, and they are
supplemented&#8212;and very materially supplemented&#8212;by
sums varying from one locality to another,
but within each locality on a uniform scale, which
are paid by the Boards of Guardians in the form
of outdoor relief. Now that situation is highly
unsatisfactory. The system of outdoor relief and
the machinery of the Guardians are not adapted
for work of this kind. They are designed to meet
the problem of individual cases of distress, not
necessarily arising from unemployment, but in
any event individual cases to be dealt with, each
on its own merits, after detailed inquiry into the
special circumstances of the case. That is the
function which the Guardians are fitted to perform,
and it is a most important function, which will still
have to be discharged by the Guardians, or by
similar local bodies, whatever the national system
<a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a><span class="pagenum" title="191"></span>of unemployment relief may be. But for dealing
with unemployment wholesale, for paying relief
in accordance with a fixed scale and without
regard to individual circumstances&#8212;for that work
the Guardians are a most inappropriate body.
They possess no qualification for it which the
Central Government does not possess, while
they have some special and serious disqualifications.</p>

<p>In any case, it is preposterous that you should
have two agencies, each relieving the same people
in the same wholesale way, the Employment
Exchanges with their scale, asking whether a man
is unemployed, and how many children he has to
support, and paying him so much, and the Guardians
with their scale, asking only the same questions and
paying him so much more. It would obviously
be simpler, more economical, and more satisfactory
in every way, if one or other of those agencies paid
the man the whole sum. And I have no hesitation
in saying that that agency should be the Central
Government. Perhaps the strongest argument in
favour of that course is that, when relief is given
locally, the money must be raised by one of the
worst taxes in the whole of our fiscal system, local
rates, which are tantamount to a tax, in many
districts exceeding 100 per cent., upon erection of
houses and buildings generally. It is foolish to
imagine that any useful end is served by keeping
down taxes at the expense of rates.</p>

<p>Serious as is the problem of national finance, the
fiscal resources of the Central Government are still
far more elastic and less objectionable than those
<a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a><span class="pagenum" title="192"></span>which the local authorities possess. I suggest,
accordingly, as a policy for the immediate future,
the raising of the scale of national relief to a more
adequate level, coupled with the abolition of what
I have termed wholesale outdoor relief in the
localities. What it is right to pay on a uniform
scale should be paid entirely by the Central
Government, and local outdoor relief should be
restricted to its proper function of the alleviation
of cases of exceptional distress after special
inquiries into the individual circumstances of each
case.</p>

<p>One final word to prevent misconception. I
have said that our present system of relief is unsatisfactory,
and I have indicated certain respects in
which I think it could be improved. But I am far
from complaining that relief is being granted throughout
the country as a whole upon too generous a
scale. Anomalies there are which, if they continued
indefinitely, would prove intolerable. But
we have been passing through an unparalleled
emergency. Unemployment in the last two years
has been far more widespread and intense than it
has ever been before in modern times, and never
was it less true that the men out of work have
mainly themselves to blame. But it has meant
far less distress, far less destruction of human
vitality, and I will add far less demoralisation of
human character than many of the bad years we
had before the war. That is due to the system of
doles, the national and local doles; and in the
circumstances I prefer that system with all its
anomalies to the alternative of a substantially
<a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a><span class="pagenum" title="193"></span>lower scale of relief. We are still in the midst of
that emergency; and if we are faced, as I think
for this decade we must expect to be faced, with
that dilemma which I indicated earlier, I should
prefer, and I hope that every Liberal will prefer,
to err by putting the scale of relief somewhat too
high for prudence and equity rather than obviously
too low for humanity and decency.</p>

<h3>By Arnold D. McNair</h3>

<h4>M.A., LL.M., C.B.E.; Fellow of Gonville and Caius
College, Cambridge; Secretary of Coal Conservation
Committee, 1916-1918; Secretary of Advisory Board
of Coal Controller, 1917-1919; Secretary of Coal
Industry Commission, 1919 (Sankey Commission).</h4>


<p>Mr. McNair said:&#8212;Need I labour the point that
there <em>is</em> a problem of the Mines? Can any one,
looking back on the last ten years, when time after
time a crisis in the mining industry has threatened
the internal peace and equilibrium of the State,
deny that there is something seriously wrong with
the present constitution of what our chairman has
described as this great pivotal industry? What
is it that is wrong? If I may take a historical
parallel, will you please contrast the political
situation and aspirations of the working-class
population at the close of the Napoleonic wars
with their industrial situation and aspirations now.
Politically they were a hundred years ago unenfranchised;
more or less constant political ferment
prevailed until the Reform Bill, and later, extensions
of the franchise applied the Liberal solution of
putting it within the power of the people, if they
wished it, to take an effective share in the control
of political affairs.</p>

<p>Industrially, their situation to-day is not unlike
their political situation a hundred years ago. Such
<a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a><span class="pagenum" title="195"></span>influence as they have got is exerted almost entirely
outside the constitution of industry, and very often
in opposition to it. Their trade unions, workers&#8217;
committees, councils of action, triple alliances,
and so forth, are not part of the regular industrial
machine, and too often are found athwart its
path. They are members of an industry with
substantially no constitutional control over it,
just as a hundred years ago they were members of
a State whose destinies they had no constitutional
power to direct.</p>

<p>This does not mean that a hundred years ago
every working man wanted the political vote, nor
that now he wants to sit on a committee and control
his industry. It meant that a substantial number
of the more enlightened and ambitious did&#8212;a
large enough number to be a source of permanent
discontent until they got it. The same is true to-day
in the case of many industries. Many men in all
classes of society are content to do their job, take
their money, go home and work in their gardens,
or course dogs or fly pigeons. They are very good
citizens. Many others, equally good citizens, take
a more mental and active interest in their job, and
want to have some share in the direction of it.
This class is increasing and should not be discouraged.
They constitute our problem. The
Liberal solution of a gradually extended franchise
has cured the political ferment. Political controversy
is still acute, and long may it remain so,
as it is the sign of a healthy political society. But
the ugly, ominous, revolutionary features of a
hundred years ago in the sphere of politics have
<a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a><span class="pagenum" title="196"></span>substantially gone or been transferred to the
industrial sphere.</p>


<h3>The Liberalisation of Industry</h3>

<p>The same solution must be applied to that sphere.
This does not mean transferring the machinery of
votes and elections to industry. It means finding
channels in industry whereby every person may
exercise his legitimate aspiration, if he should feel
one, of being more than a mere routine worker
while still perhaps doing routine work, and of
contributing in an effective manner his ideas,
thoughts, suggestions, experience, to the direction
and improvement of the industry. We have
satisfied the desire for self-expression as citizens,
and we have now to find some means of satisfying
a similar desire for self-expression as workers in
industry. That is all very vague. Does it mean
co-partnership, profit-sharing, co-operative societies,
joint committees, national wages boards, guild
socialism, nationalisation? It may mean any or
all of these things&#8212;one in one industry, one in
another, or several different forms in the same
industry&#8212;whatever experiment may prove to be
best suited to each industry. But it must mean
opportunity of experiment, and experiment by all
concerned. It must mean greater recognition by
employers of their trusteeship on behalf of their
work-people as well as their shareholders; greater
recognition of the public as opposed to the purely
proprietary view of industry; and recognition
that the man who contributes his manual skill and
<a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a><span class="pagenum" title="197"></span>labour and risks his life and limb is as much a part
of the industry as a man who contributes skill in
finance, management, or salesmanship, or the man
who risks his capital.</p>

<p>Coming to the mines, that is, the coal mining
industry (with a few incidental mines such as
stratified ironstone, fireclay, etc., which need not
complicate our argument), the first step to the
solution of the problem of the mines, <em>i.e.</em> the
collieries, the mining industry, is the solution of
the problem of the minerals. This distinction is
not at first sight obvious to all, but it is fundamental.
The ownership and leasing of the coal is one thing,
the business or industry of mining it is quite another.
State ownership of the former does not involve
State ownership of the latter. That is elementary
and fundamental. It lies at the root of what is to
follow.</p>

<p>Will you picture to yourself a section of the coal-mining
industry in the common form of the pictures
one sees of an Atlantic liner cut neatly in two so as
to expose to view what is taking place on each deck.
On top you have the landowner, under the surface
of whose land coal, whether suspected or not,
has been discovered. He may decide to mine the
coal himself, but more frequently&#8212;indeed, usually&#8212;he
grants to some persons or company a lease to
mine that coal on payment of what is called a
royalty of so much for every ton extracted. Thereupon
he is called the mineral-owner or royalty-owner,
and the persons or company who actually
engage in the business or industry of coal mining
and pay him the royalties we shall call the
<a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a><span class="pagenum" title="198"></span>colliery-owners. Do not be misled by the confusing
term &#8220;coal-owners.&#8221; Very frequently the colliery-owners
are called the &#8220;coal-owners,&#8221; and their
associations &#8220;coal-owners&#8217; associations.&#8221; That is
quite a misnomer. The real <em>coal</em>-owner is the
landowner, the royalty-owner, though it may well
happen that the two functions of owning the
minerals and mining them may be combined in the
same person. Below the colliery-owners we find
the managerial staff; below them what may be
called the non-commissioned officers of the mine,
such as firemen or deputies, who have most important
duties as to safety, and below them the
miners as a whole, that is, both the actual coal-getters
or hewers or colliers and all the other grades
of labour who are essential to this the primary
operation.</p>


<h3>The Question of Royalties</h3>

<p>Coming back to the royalty-owner, you will see
his functions are not very onerous. He signs
receipts for his royalties and occasionally negotiates
the terms of a lease. But as regards the coal-mining
industry, he &#8220;toils not, neither does he
spin.&#8221; I do not say that reproachfully, for he (and
his number has been estimated at 4000) is doubtless
a good husband, a kind father, a busy man, and a
good citizen. But as regards this industry he
performs no essential function beyond allowing
the colliery-owners to mine his coal.</p>

<p>What is the total amount annually paid in coal
royalties? We can arrive at an approximate
<a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a><span class="pagenum" title="199"></span>estimate in this way: Average output of coal for
five years before the war, roughly, 270,000,000
tons; average royalty, 5&frac12;d. per ton, which means,
after deducting coal for colliery consumption and
the mineral rights duty paid to the State by the
royalty-owner, roughly &pound;5,500,000 per annum paid
in coal royalties. Regarding this as an annuity, the
capital value is 70 millions sterling if we allow a
purchaser 8 per cent. on his money (12.5 years&#8217;
purchase), or 55&frac12; millions sterling if we allow him
10 per cent. (10 years&#8217; purchase). For all practical
purposes the annuity may be regarded as perpetual.</p>

<p>Now the State must acquire these royalties.
That is the only practicable solution, and a condition
precedent to any modification in the structure of
the coal-mining industry so long as the participants
in that industry continue unwilling or unable to
agree upon those modifications themselves. <em>Why
and how?</em> (1) First and foremost because until
then the State is not master in its own house, and
cannot make those experiments in modifying
conditions in the industry which I believe to be
essential to bring it into a healthy condition instead
of being a standing menace to the equilibrium of
the State&#8212;as it was before the war, and during
the war, and has been since the war; (2) the
technical difficulties and obstacles resulting from
the ownership of the minerals being in the hands
of several thousand private landowners and preventing
the economic working of coal are enormous.
You will find abundant evidence of this second
statement in the testimony given by Sir Richard
Redmayne and the late Mr. James Gemmell
<a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a><span class="pagenum" title="200"></span>and others before the Sankey Commission in
1919.</p>

<p>How is the State to acquire them? Not piece-meal,
but once and for all in one final settlement,
by an Act of Parliament providing adequate
compensation in the form of State securities. The
assessment of the compensation is largely a technical
problem, and there is nothing insuperable about it.
It is being done every day for the purpose of death
duties, transfer on sale, etc. Supposing, for the
sake of argument, 55&frac12; millions sterling is the total
capital value of the royalties, an ingenious method
which has been recommended is to set aside that
sum not in cash but in bonds and appoint a tribunal
to divide it equitably amongst all the mineral-owners.
That is called &#8220;throwing the bun to the
bears.&#8221; The State then knows its total commitments,
is not involved in interminable arbitrations,
and can get on with what lies ahead at once, leaving
the claimants to fight out the compensation amongst
themselves. This does not mean that the State
will have to find 55&frac12; millions sterling in cash. It
means this, in the words of Sir Richard Redmayne:
&#8220;The State would in effect say to each owner of
a mineral tract: The value of your property to
a purchaser is in present money &pound;x, and you are
required to lend to the State the amount of this
purchase price at, say, 5 per cent. per annum, in
exchange for which you will receive bonds bearing
interest at that rate in perpetuity, which bonds
you can sell whenever you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>The minerals or royalties being acquired by the
State, what then? For the first time the State
<a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a><span class="pagenum" title="201"></span>would be placed in a strategic position for the
control and development of this great national
asset. Having acquired the minerals and issued
bonds to compensate the former owners, the State
enters into the receipt of the royalty payments,
and these payments will be kept alive. We must
now decide between at least two courses: (<em>a</em>) Is
the State to do nothing more and merely wait for
existing leases to expire and fall in, and then
attach any new conditions it may consider
necessary upon receiving applications for renewals?
Or (<em>b</em>) is the State to be empowered by Parliament
to determine the existing leases at any time and so
accelerate the time when it can attach new conditions,
make certain re-grouping of mines, etc.? My
answer is that the latter course (<em>b</em>) must be adopted.
The same Act of Parliament which vests the coal
and the royalties in the State, or another Act passed
at the same time, should give the State power to
determine the then existing leases if and when it
chooses, subject to just compensation for disturbance
in the event of the existing lessees refusing to
take a fresh lease.</p>

<p>Why is course (<em>b</em>) recommended? (i) Most leases
are granted for terms varying from thirty to sixty
years. They are falling in year by year, but we
cannot afford to wait until they have all fallen in
if we are effectively to deal with a pressing problem.
(ii) The second objection to merely waiting is that
some colliery-owners (not many) might make up
their minds not to apply for a renewal of their
leases, and might consequently be tempted to
neglect the necessary development and maintenance
<a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a><span class="pagenum" title="202"></span>work, over-concentrating on output, and thus
allowing the colliery to get into a backward
state from which it would cost much time and
money to recover it&#8212;a state of affairs which could
and would be provided against in future leases, but
which the framers of existing leases may not have
visualised. I do not suggest that upon the acquisition
by the State of the minerals all the existing
leases should automatically determine. But the
State should have power to determine them on
payment of compensation for disturbance.</p>


<h3>A National Mining Board</h3>

<p>At the same time a National Mining Board
consisting of representatives of all the interested
elements, colliery-owners, managerial and technical
staffs, miners, and other grades of workers, and coal
consumers would be formed (the Mines Department
already has a National Advisory Committee); the
mining engineering element must be strongly represented,
and provision must be made for first-class
technical advice being always available. It would
then be the business of the National Mining Board
to work out its policy and decide upon the broad
principles which it wishes to weave into the existing
structure of the coal-mining industry by means of
its power of granting leases. The following principles
will readily occur to most people, and are supported
by evidence which is, in my humble judgment,
convincing, given before the various commissions
and committees which have inquired into this
industry during recent years.</p>

<p><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a><span class="pagenum" title="203"></span>Firstly, More Amalgamation or Unification of
Collieries. At present there are about 3000 pits
owned by about 1500 companies or individuals, and
producing an aggregate output of about 250 million
tons per annum. Already there have been many
large amalgamations. (i) Many fortunately situated
small pits making a good profit will be found, but
on the whole small collieries are economically
unsound. In many cases at present the units are
too small, having regard to the class of work being
done, to the cost of up-to-date machinery and
upkeep and to the variableness of the trade.
Broadly I believe it to be true that the larger
collieries are as a general rule more efficient than
the smaller ones. (ii) In respect of co-operation in
pumping, larger units would frequently make for
efficiency and reduced cost; Sir Richard Redmayne,
speaking of South Staffordshire before the Sankey
Commission, said that we had already lost a large
part of that coalfield through disagreement between
neighbouring owners as to pumping. (iii) The
advantages of larger units in facilitating the
advantageous buying of timber, ponies, rails,
machinery and the vast amount of other materials
required in a colliery will be obvious to most business
men.</p>

<p>I do not propose to chop up the coalfields into
mathematical sections and compulsorily unify the
collieries in those sections. I am merely laying
down the broad principle that to get the best out
of our national asset the National Mining Board
must bring about through its power of granting
leases the formation of larger working units than
<a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a><span class="pagenum" title="204"></span>at present usually exist. The geological and other
conditions in the different coalfields vary enormously,
and these form a very relevant factor in
deciding upon the ideal unit of size. It is conceivable
that in certain districts all the colliery-owners in
the district, with the aid of the National Mining
Board, would form a statutory company on the
lines of the District Coal Board, described in the
Report made by Sir Arthur Duckham as a member
of the Sankey Commission. One advantage accruing
from unification (to which recent events have
given more prominence) is that it mitigates the
tendency for the wages of the district to be just
those which the worst situated and the worst
managed colliery can pay and yet keep going, and
no more. This tendency seems to be recognised
and mitigated in the Agreement of June, 1921, on
which the mines are now being worked. Secondly,
Provision for Progressive Joint Control, that is,
for enabling all the persons engaged in the mining
industry either in money, in brains, or in manual
labour, or a combination of those interests, gradually
to exercise an effective voice in the direction of
their industry.</p>

<p>Some of the arguments for this principle appear
to me to be (i) that, as indicated in my opening
remarks, a sufficiently large number of the manual
or mainly manual workers in the industry ardently
desire a progressively effective share in the control
of the industry; (ii) that this desire is natural and
legitimate, having regard to the great increase in
the education of the workers and the improvement
in their status as citizens, and that so far from
<a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a><span class="pagenum" title="205"></span>being repressed it should be encouraged; (iii) that
it is the natural development of the system of
Conciliation Boards and (occasionally) Pit Committees
which has prevailed in the industry for
many years, though more highly developed in
some parts of the country than others. So far,
these organs have been mainly used for purposes
of consultation and negotiation; the time has
come when with a more representative personnel,
while not usurping the functions of a mine manager
or, on a larger scale, the managing director, they
must be developed so as to exercise some effective
share in controlling the industry. (iv) While working
conditions are not so dangerous and unpleasant as
the public are sometimes asked to believe, the
workers in this industry are exposed to an unusually
high risk of injury and loss of life, and thus have
a very direct interest in devising and adopting
measures for increased safety. These measures
nearly always mean expenditure, and thus an
increased cost of working, and so long as their
adoption (except in so far as made compulsory by
the Mines Department) rests solely with bodies on
which capital alone is represented and labour not
at all, there will be fruitful cause for suspicion and
discontent. The miners are apt to argue that
dividends and safety precautions are mutually
antipathetic, and will continue to do so as long as
they have no part or lot in the reconciliation of these
competing obligations. The question is not whether
this argument of the miners is well-founded or not:
the point is that their suspicion is natural, and
any excuse for it should be removed. (v) The
<a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a><span class="pagenum" title="206"></span>exceptionally large items which wages form in the
total cost of coal production indicates the important
contribution made by the miners to the
welfare of the industry and justifies some share
in the direction of that industry.</p>

<p>Upon the basis of typical pre-war years, the
value of the labour put into the coal mining
industry is 70 per cent. of the capital employed,
and 70 per cent. of the annual saleable value of
the coal, and yet this large labour interest has no
share in the management of the industry.</p>


<h3>The Mystery as to Profits</h3>

<p>Thirdly, More Financial Publicity. Secrecy as to
profits, which always suggests that they are as
large as to make one ashamed of them, has been
the bane of the coal-mining industry. For nearly
half a century wages have borne some relation to
<em>selling prices</em>, and there have been quarterly audits
of typical selected mines in each district by joint
auditors appointed by the owners and the miners.
But over <em>profits</em> a curtain was drawn, except in so
far as the compulsory filing at Somerset House by
public companies of a document called a Statement
in the form of a balance sheet, enabled the curious
to draw not very accurate conclusions. It is not
easy for the plain man to read a balance sheet or
estimate profits, especially when shares are being
subdivided, or when bonus shares are being issued,
or large sums carried to reserve. The result has
been continual and natural suspicion on the part
<a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a><span class="pagenum" title="207"></span>of the miners, who doubtless imagined the colliery-owners&#8217;
profits to be much larger than they were.
The miners knew that whenever they asked for an
increase in their wages they were liable to be told
that such an increase would turn a moderate profit
into a substantial loss, but the amount of the profit
they had to take on trust. Selling prices, yes, but
profits, no.</p>

<p>The war and coal control partly killed that, and
it must not return. By the settlement of June,
1921, for the first time the miners have established
the principle of the adjustment of their wages in
accordance with the proceeds of the industry &#8220;as
ascertained by returns to be made by the owners,
checked by a joint test audit of the owners&#8217; books
carried out by independent accountants appointed
by each side.&#8221; That is an important step, but does
not go anything like far enough.</p>

<p>At least two good results would accrue if colliery-owners
conducted their business more in public:
(i) a great deal of the suspicion and mistrust of the
miners would be removed, and they would realise
why and when their wages must undergo fluctuations,
and the value of the many other factors
besides wages which went to make up the pit-head
cost of coal; (ii) publicity coupled with <em>costing
returns</em> would make it possible to draw comparative
conclusions as to the cost of production in different
mines and districts, which would be a fruitful
source of experiment and improvement. Publicity
does not involve publication of lists of customers,
British or foreign.</p>


<h3><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a><span class="pagenum" title="208"></span>The Lessees of the Future</h3>

<p>How far will the lessees to whom the National
Mining Board will grant leases to work the coal be
the same persons and companies as the present
lessees? In this matter it is desirable to maintain
the maximum amount of flexibility and variety.
I do not think we have yet discovered the ideal
unit, the ideal organisation for the development
of our principal national asset. So much do our
coalfields differ in geological formation, in tradition,
in the subdivision and classification of labour,
in outlet for trade, that it is unlikely that any
single unit or organisation will be the ideal one
for every coalfield. So we must resist any attempt,
especially an early attempt, at stereotyping or
standardising the type of lessee. By trial and error
we shall learn much.</p>

<p>All the following types of lessee seem likely,
sooner or later, to demand the attention of the
National Mining Board. (I shall not touch on the
question of distribution, inland and export. That is
another and quite separate question):&#8212;</p>

<p>(i) <em>The Present Lessees.</em>&#8212;I see no reason to doubt
that in the vast majority of cases the present
lessees would be prepared to continue to operate
their mines, paying royalties to the State instead
of to the present royalty-owner. Where the unit
is sufficiently large and the management efficient,
the National Mining Board would probably grant
a fresh lease, incorporating such conditions as to
unification, joint control, and publicity as they
<a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a><span class="pagenum" title="209"></span>might consider necessary. If the present lessees
do not want the lease, there are others who will.</p>

<p>(ii) <em>Larger Groups.</em>&#8212;In a great many cases, however,
the Board would decline to grant separate
leases in respect of each of a number of small
collieries, and would indicate that they were only
prepared to receive applications for leases by
groups of persons or companies prepared to amalgamate
themselves into a corporation representing
an output of x tons <em>per annum</em>. This figure would
vary in each coalfield. In South Staffordshire, in
particular, divided ownership has had most prejudicial
effects in the matter of pumping.</p>

<p>(iii) <em>District Coal Boards.</em>&#8212;Sir Arthur Duckham&#8217;s
scheme of statutory companies known as District
Coal Boards requires consideration. Without
necessarily adopting his districts or his uniformity
of type throughout the country, there are many
areas where it might be found that voluntary
amalgamation was impracticable, and that the
desired result could only be attained by an Act of
Parliament providing for the compulsory amalgamation
of persons and companies working a specified
area and the issue of shares in the new corporation
in exchange for the previous holdings.</p>

<p>(iv) <em>Public Authorities.</em>&#8212;I should very much like
to see, sooner or later, in some area, a lessee in the
form of an organisation which, though not national&#8212;not
the State&#8212;should be at any rate public&#8212;something
on the lines of the Port of London Authority.</p>

<p>It may well be that in one or more of our coalfields
a public authority of this type, though with
larger labour representation upon it and with a
<a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a><span class="pagenum" title="210"></span>large measure of joint control from top to bottom,
would be a suitable lessee of the minerals in that
area. The important point is that public management
need not mean bureaucratic State-management
with the disadvantages popularly associated
with it.</p>

<p>(v) I have mentioned several types of possible
lessees, but it will be noticed that there is nothing
in these suggestions which would prevent the
National Mining Board from making the experiment
of working a few mines themselves.</p>

<p>To sum up. There <em>is</em> a problem of the Mines.
No sensible person should be deceived by the
quiescence of the last twelve abnormal months.
Without using extravagant language, the coal-mining
industry is a volcano liable at any moment
to erupt and involve the whole community in loss
and suffering. Therefore, as a body of citizens,
we are under a duty to seek a solution which
can be effected between the occurrence of the recurring
crises. As a body of Liberal citizens we
shall naturally seek a Liberal solution, and the
foregoing suggestions (for which no originality is
claimed) are inspired by the Liberal point of view.
They apply to the industrial sphere principles which
have been tried and proved in the political sphere,
both in the central and the local government.
Apart from State acquisition of the minerals, about
which there can surely be no question, these suggestions
merely develop tendencies and organisations
already existing within the industry. They
involve no leap in the dark, such as has been attributed
by some to nationalisation of the whole
<a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a><span class="pagenum" title="211"></span>industry, and they provide for great flexibility
and experimentation. The fact that the official
spokesmen of neither miners nor colliery-owners
may like them need not deter us. They have had
numerous opportunities of settling the problem
amongst themselves, but the &#8220;die-hards&#8221; in both
camps have always prevented it. It is time that
the general public outside the industry took the
matter in hand and propounded a solution likely
to be acceptable to the vast body of sensible and
central feeling within the industry.</p>

<h2><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a><span class="pagenum" title="212"></span><a name="THE_LAND_QUESTION" id="THE_LAND_QUESTION"></a>THE LAND QUESTION</h2>

<h3>By A.S. Comyns Carr</h3>

<h4>Member of Acquisition of Land Committee, 1918.</h4>


<p>Mr. Comyns Carr said:&#8212;The Land Question I
believe to be the most important subject in purely
domestic politics to-day, as it was in 1914. At that
date we were embarking, under the especial leadership
of one who has now deserted us, upon a comprehensive
campaign dealing with that question in all
its aspects. The present Government has filled
a large portion of the Statute Book with legislation
bearing on the land; it is not the quantity we have
to complain of, but the quality. In 1914 we had
already achieved one signal victory in carrying
against the House of Lords the Land Clauses of
the Budget of 1909-10, and although many of us
were never satisfied with the form which those
clauses took, they were valuable both as a step
in the direction of land taxation and for the
machinery of valuation which they established.
Mr. Lloyd George in his present alliance with the
Tories has sunk so low as not only to repeal those
clauses, but actually to refund to the landlords
every penny which they have paid in taxation
under them.</p>

<p>The campaign which was inaugurated in 1913
did not deal with the question of taxation only,
<a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a><span class="pagenum" title="213"></span>and for my part, although I am an enthusiast on
this branch of the subject, I have never thought
that other aspects should be neglected. We put
forward proposals for dealing with leases both in
town and country. The present Government has
carried and repealed again a series of statutes
dealing with agriculture. Their original policy
was to offer to the farmer guaranteed prices for
his produce, if necessary at the expense of the
tax-payer, and to the labourer guaranteed wages,
to be fixed and enforced by Wages Boards. Before
this policy was fully in operation it was repealed.
The farmer got some cash compensation for his
losses; the labourer has got nothing but voluntary
Conciliation Boards, with no power to do more
than pass pious resolutions. There has, however,
survived this welter of contradictory legislation,
a series of clauses which do confer upon the tenant
farmer a substantial part of the rights in his dealings
with his landlord for which we were agitating in
1914. The town lease-holder, on the other hand,
has got nothing, and it is one of the first duties of
the Liberal Party to provide him with security
against the confiscation of his improvements and
goodwill, to give him reasonable security of tenure,
and to put an end once for all to the pestilent system
of building leases which extends all over London
and to about half the other towns of England.
The evils of this system are especially to be found
in those older parts of our great cities where the
original leases are drawing to a close. In such
cases a kind of blight appears to settle on whole
neighbourhoods, and no improvements can be
<a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a><span class="pagenum" title="214"></span>carried out by either party because the landlord
cannot obtain possession, and the tenant has not,
and is unable to obtain, a sufficient length of term
to make it worth his while to risk his capital upon
them.</p>


<h3>Housing</h3>

<p>The branch of the land question to which the
Government called the greatest attention in their
election promises was Housing. On this subject
the Government have placed many pages of
legislation on the Statute Book. One can only
wish that the houses occupied as much space.
They began by informing us, probably accurately,
that up to the time of the Armistice there was an
accumulated shortage of 500,000 houses; in pre-war
days new working-class houses were required,
and to a certain extent provided, although the
shortage had then already begun, to an average
number of 90,000 a year. According to the official
figures in July last, 123,000 houses had been
completed by Local Authorities and Public Utility
Societies; 37,000 by private builders with Government
subsidies; 36,000 were under construction,
and as the Government have now limited the total
scheme (thereby causing the resignation of Dr.
Addison, its sponsor) there remain 17,000 to be built.
This is the record of four years, so clearly the
Government have not even succeeded in keeping
pace with the normal annual demand, and the
shortage has not been attacked, but actually
accentuated.</p>

<p>The cause of the failure was mainly financial.
<a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a><span class="pagenum" title="215"></span>Without attacking the roots of the evil in our land
and rating system, and without attempting to control
the output and supply of materials and building
in the way in which munitions were controlled
during the war, the Government brought forward
gigantic schemes to be financed from the supposedly
bottomless purse of the tax-payer. At the same
time the demand for building materials and labour
in every direction was at its maximum, and unfortunately
both employers and employed in the
building and allied industries took the fullest
advantage of the position to force up prices without
regard to the unfortunate people who wanted
houses. The Trade Unions concerned seem to
have overlooked the fact that if wages were raised
and output reduced houses would become so dear
that their fellow-workmen who needed them could
not attempt to pay the rents required, and the tax-payer
would revolt against the burdens imposed
upon him; thus the golden era for their own trade
was bound to come to a rapid end, and, so far from
employment being increased and prolonged, unemployment
on a large scale was bound to result.
With the Anti-Waste panic and the Geddes Axe,
social reform was cut first, and, in their hurry
to stop the provision of homes for heroes, the
Government is indulging in such false economies
as leaving derelict land acquired and laid out at
enormous cost, even covering over excavations
already made, and paying out to members of
the building trade large sums in unemployment
benefit, while the demand for the houses on which
they might be employed is left wholly unsatisfied.</p>


<h3><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a><span class="pagenum" title="216"></span>Land for Public Purposes</h3>

<p>The Acquisition and Valuation of Land for the
purpose of public improvements is a branch of the
question to which a great deal of attention was
drawn during and immediately after the war.
The Government appointed a Committee, of which
the present Solicitor-General was chairman, and
which, in spite of a marked scarcity of advanced
land reformers amongst its members, produced
a series of remarkably unanimous and far-reaching
recommendations. These recommendations dealt
with four main topics:&#8212;</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Improvements in the machinery by which
powers may be obtained by public and private
bodies for the acquisition of land for improvements
of a public character;</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Valuation of land which it is proposed to
acquire;</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Fair adjustment as between these bodies
and the owners of other land, both of claims by
owners for damage done by the undertaking to
other lands, and of claims by the promoting bodies
for increased value given by their undertaking to
other lands; and</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) The application of these principles to the
special subject of mining.</p>

<p>The Government in the Acquisition of Land Act,
1919, has adopted a great part of the Committee&#8217;s
recommendations under the second head, and
this Act has undoubtedly effected an enormous
improvement in the prices paid by public bodies
<a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a><span class="pagenum" title="217"></span>for land which they require, although, most unfortunately,
the same immunity from the extortion
of the land-owner and the land speculator has not
been extended to private bodies such as railway
companies who need land for the improvement of
public services. Moreover, it has not attempted to
bring the purchase price of land into any relation
with its taxing valuation.</p>

<p>The whole of the rest of the Committee&#8217;s recommendations
dealing with the other three points
which I have mentioned, the Government has wholly
ignored. Powers for public development can still
only be obtained by the slow, costly and antiquated
processes in vogue before the war; private owners
of lands adjoining works of a public character are
still in a position to put into their own pockets
large increases in value due to public improvements
to which they have contributed nothing, and
which they may even have impeded; the development
of minerals is still hampered by the veto of
unreasonable owners, by the necessity of leaving
unnecessary barriers between different properties,
and by other obstacles which were dealt with in
detail in the Committee&#8217;s report. An illustration
of the importance of this aspect of the question
was put before the Committee and has been emphasised
by recent events. It was stated on behalf
of the railway companies that they were prepared
with schemes for the extension of their systems
in various parts of the country, which would not
only provide temporary employment for a large
number of men on construction, and permanent
employment to a smaller number on the working
<a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a><span class="pagenum" title="218"></span>of the lines, but would also open up new residential
and industrial districts, but that it was impossible
for them to find the necessary funds unless they
could have some guarantee that at least any loss
upon the cost of construction would be charged
upon the increased value of land in the new districts
which would be created by the railway extensions.
Remarkable instances were given of the way in
which the value of land had been multiplied many-fold
by the promotion of new railways, which, nevertheless,
had never succeeded in paying a dividend to
their shareholders, and the capital cost of which
had been practically lost.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Committee were assured
that, given a charge on the increased value of
land likely to be created, there would be no difficulty
in obtaining the necessary funds without Government
assistance. When the pressure of the unemployment
problem became acute, and not before&#8212;and
then it was, of course, too late&#8212;the Government
turned their attention to this problem, and have
guaranteed the interest upon new capital to be
expended on a few of these railway extensions,
but instead of charging the guarantee upon the
increased value of land, they have charged it
upon the pocket of the tax-payer. The most
striking instance is that of the tube railway from
Charing Cross to Golders Green, now being extended
under Government guarantee to Edgware.
Those who provided the original capital have
never received any return upon their money, yet
millions have been put into the pockets of the
owners of what was undeveloped land now served
<a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a><span class="pagenum" title="219"></span>by the line, and now that the extension is being
carried out with the tax-payers&#8217; guarantee, the
land-owners will again reap the benefit untaxed.</p>

<p>The development of the natural resources of
our country was one of the promises held out by
Mr. Lloyd George to the electors in 1918. Schemes
were ready, and are still in the official pigeon-holes,
for the production of electricity on a very large
scale both from water power and from coal, which
would not only provide employment, but cheapen
the cost of production in all our industries. France,
Italy, and other countries are at this moment
carrying out similar schemes whereby they will
relieve themselves to a large extent from dependence
on British coal. But here, four years of Coalition
Government have left us practically where we were.
In France, although in many respects her social
system seems to me less enlightened than our own,
the power of the land-owner to obstruct enterprise
and development is by no means so great. Land
Reform in this country is a necessary preliminary
to the fulfilment of Mr. Lloyd George&#8217;s promises.
Development at the public expense without such
reforms will result chiefly in further burdens upon the
tax-payer and further enrichment of the landowner.</p>


<h3>Rating Relief for Improvements</h3>

<p>This brings me to the last, and in my opinion the
most important branch of the Land Question, that
relating to the reform of our system of rating and
taxation. I am myself an ardent supporter of the
policy which I think has been rather unfortunately
<a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a><span class="pagenum" title="220"></span>named the Taxation of Land Values. The vital
point about this policy is not so much that we
should tax land values, as that we should leave off
taxing buildings and other improvements of land.
The policy would be better described as the
Relief of Improvements from Taxation. Its
economic merits seem to me so obvious as hardly
to require examination. It is only because the
present system has been in force for over 300 years
that it can find any supporters. If any one were
to propose as a useful means of encouraging the
steel trade or the boot trade, or as a desirable
method of taxation, that a tax of, say, 50 per cent.
should be imposed upon the value of every ton of
steel or every pair of boots turned out in our
factories, he would be rightly and universally
denounced as a lunatic. Yet this is the system
which ever since the days of Queen Elizabeth has
been in force with regard to the building trade and
all other industries which result in the production
of improvements upon land.</p>

<p>As long as land remains unused it pays no rates
or taxes, whatever its immediate potential value.
But the moment it is brought into use, as soon as
a house, a factory, or a railway is built upon it, or
it is drained or planted&#8212;rates and taxes, which in
these days often exceed 50 per cent. of its improved
value, have to be paid, without regard even to the
question whether its use is successful in yielding
profits or not. Familiarity with this system, instead
of breeding the contempt which it deserves, has
bred a kind of passive acquiescence which is exceedingly
difficult to shake. Even such a champion
<a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a><span class="pagenum" title="221"></span>of our land system as the Duke of Bedford years
ago in his book, <em>The Story of a Great Agricultural
Estate</em>, perceived the absurdity, although he was
apparently blind to the remedy and to the application
of it to some of his estates which are not
agricultural. He converted an ordinary arable
field into a fruit garden, and discovered that his
rates were promptly trebled by reason of his
expenditure. Striking, but, nevertheless, everyday
examples may be found if we see how the system
works out in urban districts. If a new factory is
built, rates and taxes are immediately levied on
the full annual value of the building, which is a
direct charge upon production, and has to be paid
before a single person can be employed in the
factory. It therefore not only restricts the possibilities
of employment, but has to be added to
the price at which the goods can be sold.</p>


<h3>The Lesson of the Slums</h3>

<p>Or take the illustration of a slum area. Each
tumble-down tenement is rated and taxed on the
assessment based upon its annual rental value.
In many places in the central parts of towns the
total of these assessments is less than the sum for
which the whole site could be sold as a building
area, nevertheless if all the tenements fall or are
pulled down the site may remain vacant for years
and no rates or taxes are paid. But if substantial
and decent buildings are erected on the site,
immediately the assessment is raised to their full
annual value. The individual or public body that
<a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a><span class="pagenum" title="222"></span>has cleared away the slum and erected something
decent in its place is thus immediately punished
for doing so, with the result that such a thing is
seldom done except at the public expense. The
remedy for all these absurdities is quite a simple
one. No one disputes that the sums necessary for
municipal and imperial taxation have got to be
provided. The question is, in so far as they are to
be raised from lands and buildings, how can they
be assessed most fairly and with the least injury
to trade and commerce? They should be assessed
upon the value of land which is not due to any
effort of the owner or occupier; they should not
be assessed upon nor increased because of any
buildings which he may have erected or any
improvements which he may have carried out.</p>

<p>This question was closely investigated by the
Land Enquiry Committee appointed by Mr. Lloyd
George in 1913. They were unanimous in condemning
the existing system and in regarding the
one which I have just described as the ideal. They
were, however, met by great difficulties in its
immediate practical application, because, owing
to the long prevalence of the wrong system, an
immediate and total change would bring about
rather startling alterations in the value of existing
properties. The Committee closely considered these
objections, and a number of alternative methods
of bringing the change into operation gradually
and without these drastic changes in value were
put forward. The one which immediately suggested
itself as the simplest, and from many points of
view the most desirable, was to leave the rates and
<a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a><span class="pagenum" title="223"></span>taxes of existing properties on their present basis,
to impose them at their present rate on the annual
value of all unoccupied land, but to exempt from
rates and taxes all future buildings and improvements
of every kind.</p>

<p>To illustrate the way in which this would work,
let us revert to the case of a block of slum property.
As long as it remained in its present condition the
existing valuation based upon the annual rent
obtainable for it would apply, but any parts of it
which now are or may hereafter become unoccupied,
would, instead of escaping as they do now from all
rates and taxes, contribute on the basis of the value
of their sites, which would be assessed at an annual
rent for the purpose of comparison with the existing
valuations, at least until the capital values of the
whole rating area could be ascertained. If any
improvements were carried out the assessments
would not be raised on that account, as they would
be under present conditions, and if a whole area
were pulled down, replanned and rebuilt, the
assessment instead of being based, as it would be
to-day, on the annual value of the reconstructed
property, would be based upon the site value
alone. Gradually in this way site value would
become the prevalent basis of assessment. &#8220;It is
obvious,&#8221; as the Committee said in 1913, &#8220;that
unrating of future improvements is from the
economic point of view of far more importance
than the unrating of existing improvements; if
we want to encourage new buildings and new
improvements, what is really important is to
ensure that new improvements (not old ones)
<a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a><span class="pagenum" title="224"></span>shall be exempt from the burden of rates.&#8221; The
Committee were, however, compelled to reject
this suggestion at that time on the ground that
&#8220;it would cause an unfair differentiation between
the man who had already put up buildings or
improvements, and the man who put up buildings
or improvements after the passing of the Act.&#8221;
But as between buildings and improvements which
existed before the war and those which come
into existence under post-war conditions no such
unfairness could operate, because the increase in
the cost of building even to-day is greater than
the benefit which would accrue from the unrating
of improvements. The present is therefore the
unique opportunity for bringing into force this
much-needed reform in the most effective way,
free from the difficulties which had to be met in
1913. If it had been carried out immediately after
the Armistice it would, in my opinion, have done
more than anything else to solve the housing
problem, and even now it is not too late. In fact,
in view of the present unemployment it would be
most opportune. Incidentally it would soon render
unnecessary the renewal of the Rent Restriction
Act. I understand that something on these lines
has been introduced in New York to meet a similar
problem.</p>


<h3>A Rate and a Tax upon Site Values</h3>

<p>The Committee of 1913 were obliged to turn their
attention to other suggestions. They proposed:</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) That all future increases in the expenditure
<a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a><span class="pagenum" title="225"></span>of each Local Authority which had to be met out
of rates should be met by a rate upon site values
instead of upon the existing assessments; and</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) That existing expenditure should be met to
a small extent compulsorily, and to a larger extent
at the option of the Local Authority, in the same
manner.</p>

<p>There is no reason why these proposals should
not be brought into force simultaneously with that
relating to new buildings and improvements. They
made these proposals conditional upon a substantial
increase in the grants in aid to Local
Authorities, especially in necessitous areas, from
the Imperial Exchequer; and they suggested,
although they did not definitely recommend, that
a part at least of this increased grant might be
raised by means of an additional tax upon site
values. This, I think, should certainly be done,
and such a tax might be wholly or partially substituted
for the present Land Tax and Income-Tax
Schedule A, which are assessed on the wrong basis.</p>

<p>These proposals would, of course, involve the
revival and revision of the National Land Valuation
established by the Finance Act, 1909-10, which
should be made the basis of all taxation and rating
relating to real property. This would be both a
reform and an economy, because there are at present
several overlapping systems of valuation by Central
and Local Authorities, none of which are really
satisfactory even on the present unsatisfactory
basis of assessment. The existence of such a
valuation frequently revised and kept up to date,
and independent of local influences, would be
<a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a><span class="pagenum" title="226"></span>invaluable not only for purposes of rating and
taxation, but also in arriving at a fair price for the
acquisition of land for public purposes, and for
the levying of special charges upon the increased
value due to particular public improvements, such
as railway extensions, with which I have already
dealt.</p>

<p>I am not one of those who claim for these reforms
that they would cure all the evils from which the
community is at present suffering, but I do believe
that there is no other and no better way of removing
the unfairness and the restrictions of our present
methods of rating and taxation or of setting free
and stimulating the energies of our people in the
development of the resources of our country.</p>

Treasury, Feb.-June, 1915; Secretary to the Board
of Agriculture, 1915-16; a Forestry Commissioner.
Chairman of the Agricultural Organisation Society.</h4>


<p>Mr. Acland said:&#8212;I begin by laying down in a
didactic form five points which one would like to
see firmly established in our rural life: (i) intensive
production; (ii) plenty of employment at good
wages; (iii) easy access to land, and a good chance
of rising upon the land; (iv) real independence in
rural life; (v) co-operative association for many
purposes.</p>

<p>Intensive production is most important. It is
so easy to say the farmer <em>can</em> get more out of the
land, and the farmer <em>should</em> get more out of the
land, that we are tempted to continue and say that
the farmer <em>must be made</em> to get more out of the land.
But it isn&#8217;t so easy. It has been tried and failed,
and when any subject in our British political life
has been brought up to the boiling-point, and yet
nothing effective has been done, it is extremely
difficult to bring it to the boil a second time.</p>

<p>It is worth while tracing out what has actually
happened. The Government&#8217;s Agriculture Act
of 1921 contained four great principles:&#8212;(i) that
<a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a><span class="pagenum" title="228"></span>we must have more food produced in this country
(<em>a</em>) as an insurance against risk of war, (<em>b</em>) so as to
meet our post-war conditions as a debtor nation
by importing less of our food supplies; (ii) that
as the most productive farming is arable farming,
and as by maintaining a proper proportion of
arable we can on emergency make ourselves independent
for our food supplies for an indefinite
time, farmers should be guaranteed against loss
on their arable rotations; (iii) that if farmers are
to be required to produce more they must have
clear legal rights to farm their land in the most
productive way, a greater compensation for disturbance;
(iv) that as the first three principles
give security to the nation and to the farmer, it is
desirable also to give security to the worker by
permanently continuing the war-time system of
Agricultural Wages Boards.</p>

<p>These principles were duly embodied in the Bill
as it left the House of Commons:&#8212;</p>

<p>(i) The Ministry of Agriculture, acting through
the County Agricultural Committees, was given
powers to insist on a certain standard of arable
cultivation, as well as in minor matters, such as
control of weeds and of rabbits;</p>

<p>(ii) The difference between the ascertained market
price and the estimated cost of production on his
wheat and oat acreage was guaranteed to the
farmer, the guarantee not to be altered except after
four years&#8217; notice;</p>

<p>(iii) The landlord had to forfeit a year&#8217;s rent if
a tenant was disturbed except for bad farming, or
four years&#8217; rent if the disturbance was capricious;</p>

<p><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a><span class="pagenum" title="229"></span>(iv) The existing Wages Board system was
continued.</p>


<h3>The Destruction of a Policy</h3>

<p>The gradual destruction of this policy began in
the House of Lords. They allowed themselves to
be swept away by the popular cry against Government
interference with industry, and cut out the
power of control of cultivation. The Prime Minister
had said that this was an absolutely essential part
of the Bill, and of the Government&#8217;s policy, but the
Government quietly and characteristically accepted
the Lords&#8217; amendment and the Bill was passed.</p>

<p>Then troubles began. Other industries began
to ask why the Government satisfied agriculture and
not them, and as the Government could not plead
their control of agriculture in justification, no
real reply was possible. Also the cold fit came on
as regards national expenditure. The Bill for the
corn subsidies threatened to be very high. Though
Europe was starving, it could not buy, so cheap
American grain flooded our markets; but cost of
production here was still at its peak, and, for oats
especially, the amount to be paid to the farmer
threatened to be large. It was realised that it
might cost 25-30 millions to implement the guarantees
for the first year, and perhaps 10-12 millions
a year later. In short, the guarantees had to go.
Instead of four years&#8217; notice of any change, a Bill
to repeal the great Act was introduced five months
after it had been passed. And it was unfortunately
part of the bargain with the farmers who received
<a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a><span class="pagenum" title="230"></span>for the single season perhaps six or eight millions
less than they might have been entitled to under
the Act, that the Wages Boards should be abolished&#8212;and
they were. There remained of the original
structure only the depreciation of the value of all
agricultural landowners&#8217; property by about one-twentieth,
owing to the extra compensation for
disturbance.</p>

<p>Every one felt that they had been had, and they
had been. The industry which had lately been
talked up and made much of was dumped into
the dustbin. The farmers had lost their guarantees
on the strength of which, in many cases, they had
bought their farms dear or planned their rotations.
The labourers, who particularly needed the protection
of Wages Boards during a time of fall in cost of
living and unemployment, had lost all legal protection.
The landlords, willing enough to give what
was asked of them if any national purpose was to
be served, found that their loss brought no corresponding
national gain. Agriculture retired as far
as it could from any contact with perfidious Governments,
to lick its wounds.</p>

<p>That is not a good basis upon which to build
intensive cultivation or any other active policy.
There being now no legal or patriotic call to intensive
production, we are driven back to ask, &#8220;Does
intensive production pay?&#8221; and the broad answer
is that at a time of low prices it does not. There is
no doubt that slowly and steadily education will
gradually improve farming, and that farmers will
learn to find out what parts of their business pay
best and to concentrate upon them. There is also
<a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a><span class="pagenum" title="231"></span>no doubt that even at low prices there is plenty of
scope for better farming, and that better manuring,
particularly of grass land, will pay. But the
farmer is faced with an economic principle&#8212;the
law of diminishing returns. It may be stated thus:
beyond a certain point which rises and falls directly
with the value of the product, extra doses of labour
and manure do not give a corresponding return.
It is this principle which accounts for what we see
everywhere&#8212;that farmers are tending to economise
as much as they can on their labour and to let
arable land go back to grass.</p>

<p>And if this is clear to farmers who are thinking
of intensive arable farming, still more is it true in
comparing arable with grass. If you take the same
sort of quantity of arable and grass farms, farmed
by men of the same skill and diligence, over a
range of seasons under low world prices for farm
produce, you will, I believe, find something like
this: grass land needs half the capital and one-third
of the labour of arable; it produces three-quarters
the receipts with half the payments, and
yields double the profit per acre and four times
the profit on capital. The moral of all this is clear.
Unless the nation is willing to go back to protection
for agriculture, which I am glad to believe in the
general interest unthinkable, and unless it is willing
to guarantee the farmer against loss from that
method of agriculture which means most production
and most employment, we must let the farmer set
the tune and farm in the way it best suits him to
farm. We must try, in fact, not to talk too much
nonsense about intensive production as the cure
<a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a><span class="pagenum" title="232"></span>for agricultural depression. It is useful to remember
that all countries overseas which combine high
wages with agricultural prosperity have a very low
output per acre judged by our standards.</p>


<h3>Employment and Wages</h3>

<p>It follows directly from what I have just said
that a time of high costs and low prices like the
present, like the time of lower costs but still lower
prices of the late &#8217;80&#8217;s and early &#8217;90&#8217;s, is not a
favourable time for expecting employment to be
brisk or wages high. And reasons other than those
which we have yet considered make the farmer
feel his labour to be specially burdensome at present.
He finds that the prices he gets on the average are
one and one-third times what they were before the
war: what he has to buy costing from one and a
half to one and two-thirds what it cost before the
war; and he is expected in very many counties in
England and Wales to pay his workers about
double what he paid before the war. This is a strong
point for him. But the labourers&#8217; position is just
as strong. &#8220;I was not sufficiently well paid before
the war. If this is to be recognised in any way at
all, I must at the present cost of living (185) have
double my pre-war wages.&#8221; It is certainly beyond
all question that 30/- a week, which is the present
wage over a large part of England, is not, even
with only 3/- a week rent for house and garden,
enough to keep a man and his wife and family in a
state of real efficiency. Yet I know from personal
experience that this fact is not properly recognised
<a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a><span class="pagenum" title="233"></span>in practice. If one tries to pay more one is regarded
as a very rich man, and an extremely stupid one&#8212;an
idea erroneous as to one&#8217;s wealth and possibly
exaggerated as to one&#8217;s mentality.</p>

<p>How have the two conflicting views of farmer
and labourer been reconciled in practice. I can
only say that so far as my own knowledge extends&#8212;bearing
in mind that the farmer has not the
business man&#8217;s habit of cheerfully setting off a bad
year against a good (for the business man knows
that trade must improve some time, and then he
will make profits, while the farmer has no certainty
that things will improve)&#8212;things might well have
been worse. There has been a good deal of mutual
consideration and desire to make the best of difficult
circumstances. I have, however, little doubt that
it would have been better had the Wages Boards,
which had controlled the rise in wages during the
rise in the cost of living, regulated the fall in wages
during its fall&#8212;relaxing control perhaps later
when things became more stable.</p>

<p>The reason why I think that things might have
been worse is that the District Wages Committee
left a good legacy to the voluntary Conciliation
Committees which followed them&#8212;the men serving
on the latter were those who under the Wages
Board system had learned to negotiate with and
to know and respect the workers&#8212;generally some
of the best farmers in their districts&#8212;and they
genuinely tried not to let the workers down with
too much of a bump; on the other hand, they
knew that the only value their recommendations
could have was that they should be voluntarily
<a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a><span class="pagenum" title="234"></span>observed, and therefore they took care not to
recommend rates higher than those which the least
favourably situated farmers in the district could
manage to pay&#8212;which meant rates lower than
many might have been willing to give. This
means that any general rate agreed to voluntarily
will be rather on the low side. But I would rather
have a rate which is generally observed, even if it
is rather low, than that every farmer should be a
law unto himself. If there is no recognised standard,
and one man with impunity pays a lower rate than
his neighbours, other rates also tend to come down,
and then the process begins over again.</p>

<p>Looking to the future, the only thing that I can
say with any certainty about the wages question
is that it needs very careful watching. Let us be
sure first of our principle, that the first charge on
land, as on any other industry, should be a reasonable
standard of living for the workers. Then let us
be sure of the fact that there is over a very large
part of England and Wales no certain prospect of
an improvement in the condition of the labourer compared
with conditions ten years ago. The dangers
to be feared are that in the present lamentable weakness
of the men&#8217;s unions large sections of farmers
may break away from the recommendations of
their leaders; and that if depression continues and
war savings become depleted farmers will tend to
push wages down in self-preservation. These
things must be watched. If the general condition
of agriculture improves without a corresponding
improvement in the workers&#8217; condition, or if conditions
get worse and the brunt of the burden
<a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a><span class="pagenum" title="235"></span>is transferred to the labourer, we ought to be
prepared to advocate a return to the old Wages
Boards or the adoption of a Trade Board system.
It must, I think, be a cardinal point of our Liberal
faith that though it is better to leave industrial
questions to be adjusted as much as possible by
the parties concerned in the industry, the State
must be ready to step in in any case in which the
workers have not developed the power by their own
combination to secure reasonable conditions and
prospects. It is to the prospects that I now turn.</p>


<h3>Access to the Land</h3>

<p>I mean by this that there should be as many
chances as possible for men and women who have
an inclination for country pursuits to take up
cultivation of the soil; the freest opportunity for
experiment in making a living out of the land; and
good chances for those who have started on the land
ladder to rise to the top of it.</p>

<p>The three things which stand in the way are:&#8212;</p>

<p>(i) The cost of building and equipment;</p>

<p>(ii) The practice under which the cultivator
provides all the movable capital;</p>

<p>(iii) The handicap on free use of land imposed
upon its owners by the compensation clauses of the
Agriculture Act.</p>

<p>These obstacles do real harm, in the first place,
because a very large proportion of farms in this
country are the wrong size: too large for a man to
work with his hands, and too much for him to
work with his head, as Sir Thomas Middleton has
<a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a><span class="pagenum" title="236"></span>well said. Figures show quite conclusively that
whether you take production per acre or production
per man, the farm of from 100 to 150 acres is
economically the worst-sized unit. Probably more
than half of our farms lie between 70 and 100 acres.
We should get far more out of the land if all were
either below 80&#8212;so that a man and his family
could manage them&#8212;or above 180, so that there
would be a chance of applying to production the
most scientific methods and up-to-date machinery.</p>

<p>But movement, either towards breaking up
existing holdings or throwing them together, will
be extremely slow. The one process means building
new houses and buildings, which is prohibitive in
price; and the other, also fresh building and the
abandonment of hearths and homes, which is prohibited
both by price and by sentiment. Any
change in either direction is almost prohibitive
to the new poor landowner class, because if one
makes any change, except when a tenant dies or
moves of his own accord, one forfeits a year&#8217;s rent.</p>

<p>I have not yet mentioned the difficulty about
capital. Under our British method, if a man wants
a farm he must have capital&#8212;about &pound;10 per arable
acre and about &pound;5 for grass. This is a great bar to
freedom of experiment and the greatest bar on the
way up the agricultural ladder. There ought to
be free access to our farms by town brains, which
can often strike out new and profitable lines if
given a chance. It is not good for agriculture, and
it does not promote that sympathy and contact
and interchange which should exist between town
and country, that a start in farming should need
<a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a><span class="pagenum" title="237"></span>a heavy supply of capital. If our landlords were
better off they might well try some of the continental
systems, under which the landlord provides not
only the farm and buildings, but the stock and
equipment, and receives in addition to a fair rent
for the land half the profits of the farm. But it is
vain to hope for this under present conditions, and,
for good or ill, the newly rich does not buy land.
He knows too much, and he can get what he wants
without it. He may lease a house, he does take
shooting, but he won&#8217;t buy an estate.</p>

<p>When thinking of the importance of freedom of
experiment and of a ladder with no missing rungs,
I have my mind on the possibility of the owner of
one estate of from 5,000 to 10,000 acres throwing all
the farms and many of the fields together and
making his best tenants fellow-directors with him
of a joint enterprise, one doing the buying and
selling, one looking after the power and the tractors
and implements, one planning the agricultural
processes, one directing the labour and so on. This
gives a prospect of the greatest production and the
greatest profit, and it gives a really good labourer
a chance which at present he has not got. At
present, unless he leaves the land, in nine cases
out of ten once a labourer always a labourer. My
vision would give him a chance to become, first,
foreman, then assistant manager, manager, director,
and managing-director. It ought to be tried&#8212;but
how one&#8217;s tenants would loathe it, and quite natural
too! At present if things go wrong, if it&#8217;s not the
fault of the Government or the weather, it&#8217;s the
farmer&#8217;s own fault. On my joint-stock estate
<a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a><span class="pagenum" title="238"></span>every director and manager would feel that all his
colleagues were letting him down and destroying
his profits. It is hard to make people accept at all
readily, in practice, the teaching that they are their
brothers&#8217; keeper.</p>

<p>The scheme could hardly be started with men
accustomed to the present methods, and the cost
of obtaining vacant possession of land would make
it difficult to try with new men. I am sure, however,
that something of the sort is a good and hopeful
idea, and the best way of making the ladder complete.
And I am emboldened to think that something
of the sort will be tried gradually in some
places, when I see the number of landlords&#8217; sons
who are in this and other universities taking the
best courses they can get in the science and economics
of agriculture. They know this is the only way to
retain a remnant of the old acres. It is quite new
since the war&#8212;and a most hopeful sign.</p>


<h3>Independence</h3>

<p>I need not urge the importance in our villages of
real independence of life. It was the absence of
independence combined with long working hours
and little occupation for the hours of leisure, which,
more than low wages, caused the pre-war exodus
from the country. Should the prospects of industry
improve, but agriculture remain depressed, there
will be another exodus from the country-side of
the best of the young men who have come back to
it after the war. It is of first-class importance,
both from the national and from the agricultural
<a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a><span class="pagenum" title="239"></span>point of view, that they should stay, for there was
a real danger before the war that agriculture might
become a residual industry, carried on mainly by
them, too lethargic in mind and body to do anything
else.</p>

<p>In a preface which he wrote to Volume I of the
Land Report, as chairman of Lloyd George&#8217;s Land
Inquiry Committee (it seems a long time ago now
that Lloyd George was a keen land reformer), my
father sketched out the idea of setting up commissions
to report parish by parish in each county,
in the same way that commissions have reported
on the parochial charities. They would record
how the land was distributed, whether the influence
of the landowners told for freedom or against it,
whether there was a chance for the labourer to get
on to the land and to mount the ladder. Whether
there was an efficient village institute, whether
there were enough allotments conveniently situated,
whether the cottagers were allowed to keep pigs
and poultry, and what the health and housing
were like.</p>

<p>It is a good idea, and should be borne in mind.
I confess I do not know enough to know whether
it is now as desirable as it seemed to be before the
war. I would fain hope not, but I am not sure.
I believe that there is a good deal more real independent
life in the villages now than there was ten
years ago. There are, I think, now fewer villages
like some in North Yorkshire before the war, in
which the only chance for a Liberal candidate to have
a meeting was to have it in the open-air, after dark
on a night with no moon, and even then he needed
<a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a><span class="pagenum" title="240"></span>a big voice&#8212;for his immediate audience was apt
to be two dogs and a pig. Now, it seems to me that
people like having political meetings going on, but
do not bother to listen to any of them.</p>

<p>As to the present, there has been lately, within
my knowledge, a great building of village institutes.
There has been a tremendous development of
football. Village industries, under the wise encouragement
of the Development Commission,
are reviving. Motor buses make access to town
amusements much easier, and cinemas come out
into the village. There is revived interest and
very keen competition in the allotment and cottage
garden shows. Thus it is, at any rate, down our
way&#8212;but no one can know more than his own
bit of country. On these and similar matters we
ought to think and watch and meet together to
report and discuss. We need more Maurice Hewletts
and Mrs. Sturge Grettons to tell us how things
really are, for nothing is so difficult to visualise as
what is going on slowly in one&#8217;s own parish.</p>


<h3>Co-operation</h3>

<p>I come lastly to co-operation. You will think
me biased when I speak of its possibilities. I am.
I have been for eighteen years on the governing
body of the Agricultural Organisation Society, and
happen now to be its chairman, and am therefore
closely in touch with the work of organising
co-operative effort. One sees fairly clearly how
difficult it is to make any class of English agriculturists
combine for any mutual purpose, how worth
<a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a><span class="pagenum" title="241"></span>while it is, and what almost unexpected opportunities
of useful work still exist. Thanks largely
to untiring work by Sir Leslie Scott&#8212;who gave
up the chairmanship of the society on his recent
appointment as Solicitor-General&#8212;the country is
now fairly covered by societies for purchasing
requirements co-operatively&#8212;principally fertilisers,
feeding-stuffs, and seeds. There are also affiliated
to the movement I have mentioned, many useful
co-operative auction marts, slaughter-house
societies, bacon factories, wool societies, egg and
poultry societies, and fruit and garden produce
societies (but not nearly enough), besides a thousand
or so societies of allotment holders which, thanks
largely to our friend, George Nicholls, set all the
others an example in keenness and loyalty to their
parent body.</p>

<p>The <em>ideal</em> is that where a society exists the main
raw materials of the industry shall be bought
wholesale instead of retail, and the main products
of the industry sold retail instead of wholesale;
that thereby middlemen&#8217;s and other profits shall
be reduced to a reasonable figure, and that the
consumer shall get the most efficient possible
service with regard to his supplies. It is also the
ideal that farmers and others shall learn more
comradeship and brotherhood; that the big and
small men alike shall become one community
bound together for many common purposes, and
that thus the cultivators of the soil shall lose that
isolation and selfishness which is a reproach against
them. The ideal is, however, not always realised.
The farmer likes to have a co-operative society to
<a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a><span class="pagenum" title="242"></span>keep down other people&#8217;s prices, but, having helped
to form a society, he does not see why he should be
loyal to it if a trader offers him anything a shilling
a ton cheaper. A good committee is formed, but
the members think they hold their offices mainly
in order to get first cut for themselves at some
good bargain the society has made, and they start
with the delusion that they are good men of business.
Things, therefore, get into the hands of the manager,
and it is astonishing how much more quickly a
bad manager can lose money than a good one can
make it. And if in these and other ways it is uphill
work with farmers&#8217; societies, the work is still more
uphill with small-holders. It is the breath of their
nostrils to bargain individually, and if a society is
started they will only send their stuff to be sold
when they and every one else have a glut, ungraded
and badly packed&#8212;and then they grumble at
getting a low price.</p>

<p>But all co-operative work is abundantly worth
while. And the field of co-operation is not limited
to the purchase of supplies or the sale of produce.
It ought to cover the use of tractors and threshing
sets and the installation and distribution of power.
And if agriculture gets a chance of settling down
to a moderate amount of stability and prosperity,
it would not be beyond the bounds of hope that
part, at any rate, of the profits of co-operative
enterprise should be used to develop the amenities
of the common life of the community&#8212;to provide
prizes for the sports and the flower show&#8212;the capital
to start an industry for the winter evenings, and even
seats for the old people round the village green.</p>

<p><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a><span class="pagenum" title="243"></span>Times are not propitious for increasing the
productivity of our land, excepting by the slow
processes of education&#8212;which work particularly
slowly in agriculture. Nor are they immediately
propitious for raising the workers&#8217; standard of life,
though we should never leave go of this as an
essential. But many of us can, if we will, help a
good man to start on the land, or help a man who
has made good on the land to do better. Many of
us can help to develop real independence of life in
the villages and, through co-operation, those kindly
virtues of friendliness and helpfulness to others
and willingness to work for common ends which
are sometimes not so common as they might be.
And those who <em>can</em> do any of these things <em>should</em>,
without waiting for legislation&#8212;for the legislator
is a bruised reed.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
